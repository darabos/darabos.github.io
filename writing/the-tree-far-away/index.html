  <h1>The Tree Far Away</h1>
  <h2>by Daniel Darabos, 2015</h2>
</div>
<div class="container story">

<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >Philip lived with his parents in a small house. His parents
had built their house at the very end of a young leaf. The
tip of the leaf swayed the most when the wind blew, so
his mother asked Philip every day to be careful. But
on quiet evenings they all sat together at the edge
of the leaf and dipped their feet into the endless
abyss.
<!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   Thousands of leaves stretched out below them.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Is every leaf like ours?&#8221; Philip asked his father.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;On this twig, yes. But on the branch beneath us the
fairies speak a foreign language. Above us they knit
their houses on the bottom of the leaves because it is
cold and the surface is more slippery. Each branch is
different. There are places where fairies have never
been.&#8221;
<!--l. 64--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >   Philip became an explorer the very next day. He
packed a dozen pollens, two folded fruit fly wings, and a
blank travel diary and set off toward the stalk of the
leaf.
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   The leaf where Philip lived was called Dewington. At
every sunrise beads of dew grew on the roofs of
the houses. When they grew as large as a pollen,
they tumbled into the gutters. There they merged
into spheres the size of a fairy&#8217;s head and bounced
off onto the veins of the leaf. The veins were the
road network of Dewington, and every morning
hundreds of dew spheres rolled across them. The kids
played ball with the spheres while the adults got
annoyed whenever they knocked down a bench or a
pot. By the time the sun had wholly risen above
the horizon, the water droplets all flocked to the
center of the leaf and merged into a giant sphere. The
sphere sparkled in the light of the new day and all the
inhabitants of the leaf made a stop at Dewington&#8217;s
main square in time to draw from the fresh dew
water.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   Philip too was headed for the main square. The
chitin shop was just opening up as he reached the
corner of the main street. He took a longing look at
the wares. Among the shiny blades, thin needles,
and hard plates in the window today there was an
armor fashioned of radiant scales. It would have been
perfect if he went hunting, Philip thought, but the
hard suit would have just constrained him as an
explorer.
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Stop it!&#8221; someone shouted from the right. As soon as
Philip turned in the direction of the desperate voice, a
dew ball the size of a loaf of bread hit him in the face. He
reached after the bounding drop but lost his balance and
fell over onto the leaf.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   Mary ran past, helped him up, and they chased after
the drop of water together.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Babouche is in this drop!&#8221; the fairy girl cried and
pounced on the drop. She reached it but could not grab
it from both sides, and the ball bounced from her
hands. Philip saw now why they were chasing after it.
Mary&#8217;s paramecium was trapped in the ball of water.
Parameciums are good swimmers, but if the small drop
were to merge into the large one in the main square,
Babouche would have to spend the rest of the day
there.
<!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >   The drop glided smoothly over the vein of the main
street. Philip was a good runner and able to keep up with
it, but he knew it would not be easy to stop the ball.
There is nothing more slippery than the surface of water
droplets. If they could not squeeze it in somewhere, they
would never pull Babouche out of it. &#8220;We have to get it
onto the Stain!&#8221; Philip shouted and shoved the drop into
an alley.
<!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >   The ambience here was nothing like on the main
street. There were no inviting shop windows, no fresh
scents drifted from restaurants, and the drop on the main
square towering above the houses did not fill this
street with its radiance. The murmur of life faded
away behind them. As they chased the drop of dew
through the passage they could soon smell the Stain
ahead.
<!--l. 116--><p class="indent" >   They ran past the last houses and found themselves
in an endless brown desert. The withered leaf creaked
and crackled loudly beneath their feet, but they did not
want to lose Babouche now. The drop started to slowly
shrink. The dry, dead surface gradually soaked up its
moisture.
<!--l. 121--><p class="indent" >   A dried flake collapsed under Mary&#8217;s foot. She fell,
and more flakes broke under her, outlining her fallen
shape. Philip turned back and took an anxious step
toward Mary.
<!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Run on! Babouche is headed for the middle of the
Stain!&#8221; Mary said.
<!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;We cannot run on. The leaf is entirely dead here. We
have to be very cautious,&#8221; Philip said and helped her up.
They pushed on more carefully now. They still saw
Babouche and also that the drop was almost completely
gone. Once the dew no longer covered him, Babouche
tumbled to a stop. Still dizzy, he righted himself and
sniffed around. He thoroughly shook his hair and
nodded toward Mary.
<!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Do not move!&#8221; a voice boomed from the distance.
The two little fairies and the paramecium looked
anxiously to the center of the Stain. From the distance a
caterpillar&#8217;s head stared back at them.
<!--l. 138--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 140--><p class="noindent" >   Every child knew the story of the Stain. Months
before, Balthazar, the caterpillar, attacked Dewington.
Knocking over houses on his way, he barged into the
main square. The fairy warriors fought bravely, but his
hard skull protected him. The caterpillar headed from
the main square to the most beautiful part of the city.
He waded through the glades of the royal gardens,
pierced cellulose shop windows in the court market,
and swallowed barrels full of nectar in the king&#8217;s
stables.
<!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   His rampage reached the royal palace. He tore
through its silk walls and dragged his soft body toward
the treasury. The palace staff panicked and fled, but
George, King of Dewington, received Balthazar in the
throne room.
<!--l. 152--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;This leaf belongs to the fairies. If you would like to
leave alive, turn around now and go back to whence you
came,&#8221; George said and lifted the royal sword off the
wall. This weapon was forged against the larger
inhabitants of the tree. Only the strongest of the fairies
were able to wield it. The shiny blade was many times
George&#8217;s height. The tip almost reached the ceiling of the
palace.
<!--l. 159--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I will be leaving,&#8221; the caterpillar hissed, &#8220;once I have
fed, pupated and grown wings!&#8221;
<!--l. 162--><p class="indent" >   He swung his head and snapped his mandibles
toward George. The king raised his sword to block
the attack. The chitin clashed against the metal,
and sparks poured onto the floor of the palace. The
strength of the caterpillar threw George toward the
end of the hall, but he managed to grab a column
and change his direction. He flanked Balthazar, cut
down with the blade and severed the head of the
caterpillar.
<!--l. 169--><p class="indent" >   George sidestepped the aimlessly twisting body and
looked into the eyes of the huge head. The rage of the
short battle still burned in his veins. He was not
only angry at Balthazar for what the caterpillar had
destroyed, but also for what George had to destroy
because of him. The dying caterpillar would never
become a butterfly. At this thought the king was
consumed with guilt. The hilt of the sword slipped from
his sweaty palms and banged on the floor of the
palace.
<!--l. 177--><p class="indent" >   As in all fairy homes, the floor of the palace was
the leaf itself. Industrious fairies had sewn patterns
into the thin layer of wax that covered the plant
cells in the throne room. The heavy sword lay across
the path of an ant caravan embroidered in golden
thread. George&#8217;s eyes followed the line of ants to
Balthazar.
<!--l. 183--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;No!&#8221; George shouted. But even if the caterpillar had
a drop of goodwill in him, he had not enough life left to
heed the king&#8217;s command. His mandibles had dug into
the decorated leaf and a bitter venom was seeping into
the wound. The leaf turned black around the wound and
the dark stain started to grow.
<!--l. 188--><p class="indent" >   George stumbled back. The black venom filled the
floor of the palace right in front of his eyes. He watched
helplessly through a window as the streets around the
palace were painted black one by one. He felt as though
the caterpillar had poisoned his heart and the bitterness
had spread through his body. The streets turned
black, the buildings turned black and the sky did
too.
<!--l. 194--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 196--><p class="noindent" >   Many days had passed since then. The one-time king
now served hot tea to his guests. Mary and Philip
sipped quietly from the steaming cups and looked at
the wasteland through a round window. George&#8217;s
voice had stopped them from chasing after Babouche
onto a dangerously fragile region. Weeks earlier, the
palace stood here, and here fought Balthazar and
George. The caterpillar injected his poison into the
leaf right here, and those who fled from him never
returned to the blackened streets. Thankfully, there was
not enough of the poison to kill the entire leaf. But
within the Stain the leaf withered and the houses
collapsed.
<!--l. 206--><p class="indent" >   The caterpillar&#8217;s body had dried up and drifted away.
The head, however, still clung to the dead leaf. The wind
took the palace as well, but the king could not leave the
Stain behind. He took up residence inside Balthazar&#8217;s
dried head, and they looked out through his eyes over
the wasteland.
<!--l. 211--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;How could the Stain be healed?&#8221; the ever-curious
Philip asked.
<!--l. 213--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;No such magic, unfortunately,&#8221; the old king replied.
&#8220;But the spring will heal all.&#8221;
<!--l. 216--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;We are big kids now,&#8221; Mary interjected. &#8220;We know
the spring is not real. It is only our parents who decorate
the house in the morning.&#8221;
<!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Oh, you have really grown up! Philip may indeed be
swinging the royal sword come tomorrow! But I am sure
you have noticed that the days are shorter now than
when you were small. You can play less and have to
learn more.&#8221;
<!--l. 223--><p class="indent" >   The two youngsters nodded ruefully.
<!--l. 225--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;With time the days run out, the leaves wither, and
the fairies hide. It will be your duty to emerge when the
spring comes and rebuild everything. Your leaf will grow
as you build your town, and you will play spring for your
little fairies.&#8221;
<!--l. 230--><p class="indent" >   Philip and Mary listened to George&#8217;s prediction. The
adults always talked about the seasons. But the kids
could not yet decide whether they really existed or
not.
<!--l. 234--><p class="indent" >   They accepted another cup and listened to a story
about how George had bought the leaf of Dewington
from the ants for the price of seven aphids. They said
goodbye then, and the king taught them the safe path
through the cracked surface of the Stain.
<!--l. 239--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Thank you for your help,&#8221; Mary said on their way
back. &#8220;Thanks to us, Babouche is not stuck inside the
drop!&#8221;
<!--l. 242--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I am glad to have helped.&#8221;
<!--l. 244--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;If you want to help some more, let us fetch a little
water for my fungus.&#8221;
<!--l. 246--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 248--><p class="noindent" >   The main square was alive with a colorful crowd of
fairies. Most came to fetch water from the huge drop of
dew. But many had stopped for a chat, vendors offered
their wares, and old fairies bathed in the light of the
rising sun where the big lens of the drop focused it into a
spot.
<!--l. 253--><p class="indent" >   Mary formed a capillary from her hands as well as
any adult. She touched it to the surface of the drop, and
Philip hurried to pick the outflow of dew dumplings into
his bag. One droplet tried to roll away, but Babouche
sipped it up.
<!--l. 258--><p class="indent" >   Mary was growing a tiny fungus in her room. It was a
present from her aunt, and she wholeheartedly believed
it would turn sweet as honey with just a little more
tending. Only someone who never tasted it could have
believed that, Philip thought. He had tried a little tendril
the last time they came over for lunch. It was terribly
tough and bitter. Since then he avoided the oddly
shaped germ. He excused himself on account of his
important work as an explorer and said farewell to
her.
<!--l. 266--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 268--><p class="noindent" >   Philip came to the stem of the leaf. He looked back
one last time at the drop shining among the fairy
buildings and knew this was his moment. He was about
to become an explorer. He jumped on the stalk and slid
into the unknown on his backside.
<!--l. 273--><p class="indent" >   He remembered her grandmother&#8217;s stories about the
ground. The old fairy had told him that even the ants
were afraid to climb down that far because there
were monsters there that could swallow a whole ant.
Fortunately, these creatures were too large to walk upon
the leaves, so the fairies had nothing to fear. But what if
a little fairy left the leaves?
<!--l. 279--><p class="indent" >   The leaf grew from a young twig. The stalk had big
green bumps at its base to hold it firm. These bumps
cushioned Philip&#8217;s arrival. Although he had no choice in
the matter, he decided he was better off with three small
thumps than a single big one. Fearing his grandmother&#8217;s
monsters, he slid into a fairy-sized cranny and peeked
out from there. He saw monsters neither to the left nor
to the right.
<!--l. 286--><p class="indent" >   The twig was about the width of a whole block
of buildings and stretched to the horizon in both
directions. Its surface was much rougher than the leaf.
A fairy could always find a niche here that would
serve as emergency shelter. This put Philip at ease
as he climbed out of the narrow crack. He circled
the stem and thought about how he would climb
back up at the end of the expedition. The stem was
covered in a strong wax. Pants slipped well on it, but
small fairy fingers would pierce it and find a good
grip.
<!--l. 294--><p class="indent" >   Philip saw which way the stalk of the leaf leaned and
walked off in that direction. He looked up curiously. He
had spent his entire life on its other side, but had never
before seen the bottom of the leaf. He could see the
veins, and the brown circle of the Stain was clear as well.
Philip unwrapped his travel diary and made a drawing of
what he saw. He had hardly seen a prettier map of
Dewington!
<!--l. 301--><p class="indent" >   After a bit of a walk he glimpsed a pair of antennae
bobbing above the curvature of the branch. He had
nothing to fear from insects on Dewington. But Philip did
not know what to expect in the wilderness outside of the
leaf. He watched the approaching antennae from a
crevice. The antennae undulated on the great black head
of an ant, and a body followed behind. A bit later there
was another ant head and another ant body. Three ants
were approaching Philip.
<!--l. 308--><p class="indent" >   The ants were regular guests in Dewington, although
the fairies did not always understand them. Shiny chitin
covered their huge bodies, stronger perhaps than even
the royal sword. The leaf trembled beneath their feet.
Their mandibles could have carried all the houses of the
main street at once. Yet they never caused trouble. Each
day an ant would come, walk around the leaf without
a word, taste the dewdrop, and return to where
he came from. Philip&#8217;s parents said the ants were
looking for garbage, and therefore everything had to be
kept clean. Mary had heard they were looking for
bad kids. And yet, Philip was not taken when he
misbehaved.
<!--l. 318--><p class="indent" >   Philip felt that he had not been bad that day. In fact
he had been good. He stood in front of the ants and
awaited them with his hands on his hips. The ants
seemed big from afar, but they just grew and grew as
they approached. Philip could have hidden behind one
leg.
<!--l. 323--><p class="indent" >   The ants did not notice Philip, or they were in a great
hurry. The heads, thoraces, and abdomens the size of
houses passed high over him. He spun around in surprise
below.
<!--l. 327--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Wait! I am headed the same way! Let&#8217;s go together!&#8221;
he shouted and waved, but the ants did not wait. Philip
ran after them and pounced on one of the huge legs. He
held on tight as the foot rose into the air. &#8220;Wait, hold on!
I am going to fall!&#8221; he pleaded with the ant. But it
was either deaf or did not speak the language of
the fairies. Philip was a skilled climber, of course,
and with some difficulty managed to reach the ant&#8217;s
knees. &#8220;Why such a hurry? Is the winter chasing after
you?&#8221;
<!--l. 335--><p class="indent" >   Philip walked over the ant&#8217;s thigh, cut across the
jungle of hair on the thorax, and found his way to the
ant&#8217;s head. &#8220;Here we go,&#8221; he said as he settled between
two hairs perfect for holding onto. &#8220;We can go on
now.&#8221;
<!--l. 339--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I am Philip, the explorer. You must have been to
many places, Mr.&#x00A0;Ant. Have you been to the top of the
tree? It must be quite the view. Maybe you can see
beyond the end of the longest branch. Although, I do not
know how well you ants see. Perhaps you do not
even see me? You do not hear me. Not even when I
sing?&#8221;

   </div>
<!--l. 369--><p class="indent" >   At the end a low bass voice repeated the melody of
the last line. The ant under Philip was humming
it.
<!--l. 372--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Oh, so you can hear me! What is your name? Where
are we going? Why did you not say anything?&#8221;
<!--l. 375--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Yes, I can hear you, Philip. My name is Tony. We are
patrolling the boundaries of the empire. If someone
intruded, something broke, or we found something
of value, we would report it to the hive. We have
important work to do. We do not have time to talk and
sing.&#8221;
<!--l. 380--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I see,&#8221; Philip said. &#8220;Can I ask you something? How
big is the empire? Is the whole tree your empire?&#8221;
<!--l. 383--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;No,&#8221; Tony replied. &#8220;From where we are it extends six
branches down and four branches up. The tree has no
end, but an empire needs a border. Otherwise it could
not be defended.&#8221;
<!--l. 387--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;But each branch has an end, and the trunk also gets
thinner the higher you go. It ends at the top, and there is
nothing but blue sky above it. Had it no end, the infinite
number of leaves would block out the sky. Sunlight
would never reach us and we would live in eternal
darkness,&#8221; Philip explained. &#8220;Did they not teach you in
school?&#8221;
<!--l. 393--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Ants do not go to school. We know all as soon as we
hatch. We do not need to learn.&#8221;
<!--l. 396--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I wish I could be an ant! But what if someone
invents something new? Will you also know that? Or will
only those that hatch later know it?&#8221;
<!--l. 399--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;A good ant does not invent anything. We take the
bad ants to the border of the empire and never let them
return.&#8221;
<!--l. 402--><p class="indent" >   Philip did not like that. The best thing about
exploration was learning new things. But he kept quiet
rather than argue with his travel companions. Especially
given that Tony was also his swift mount. He leaned back
comfortably instead and enjoyed the sunlight breaking
through the canopy. What could the outcast ant inventors
be up to? Surely they are sad that they cannot go home.
But they can go explore. And if they have invented
something clever, they must fare even better than the
ants of the empire. They may be building wonderful
cities in remote leaves. Maybe they roll whole leaves
into palaces and live in them at the very top of the
tree.
<!--l. 412--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 414--><p class="noindent" >   Philip awoke to some nudging. The touch was similar
to Babouche&#8217;s, but hairless and hard. As he opened his
eyes, four long black antennae were swaying overhead.
He sat up and saw that he was still riding on Tony&#8217;s head.
But they were facing another ant, and its antennae had
woken up Philip.
<!--l. 419--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Where are we? Why did we stop? I fell asleep for a
little while,&#8221; the fairy said.
<!--l. 422--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;We have reached the end of the patrol route. This is
the border of the empire. We found everything to
be in order and are going back to the hive,&#8221; Tony
said.
<!--l. 426--><p class="indent" >   Philip was curious about the ant hive, but the
ants did not invite him, and he did not want to be
pushy. Instead, he looked up to the top of the tree and
took a deep breath. The trunk seemed to stretch
into infinity, and what the ants said had worried
Philip a little. But he was determined to climb to the
top of the tree and prove that they did not know
everything.
<!--l. 432--><p class="indent" >   Philip thanked the ants for carrying him that far and
said goodbye. He also learned that the empire of
woodpeckers lay above the empire of ants. It was
extremely dangerous for insects, but Philip knew that
birds were so unbelievably large that they could
not see fairies. He was more afraid of the amoebae
and other feral protists hiding in the rough of the
bark.
<!--l. 438--><p class="indent" >   The thick bark made the climb easier. Philip did not
have to use his hands. It was just like going up a
staircase. Moisture remained here and there in the dark
corners of the bark; Philip carefully avoided these. Wild
relatives of Babouche lived in the water droplets. They
would have surely snapped at the fairy&#8217;s ankles if he
stepped on the water.
<!--l. 444--><p class="indent" >   At the bottom of one deep shadow, however,
something bright caught Philip&#8217;s eye. It was neither the
glint of water nor of chitin. As Philip searched for
handholds and flat surfaces on the way to the small cave,
the glint seemed to float in the air. Its shape and
size was like a fairy&#8217;s forearm, but more angular. Its
surface gleamed in the darkness of the cave as it
rotated. Philip could not take his eyes off of it. Leaving
behind his usual caution, he approached the curious
object.
<!--l. 452--><p class="indent" >   The tiny space under the bark was almost completely
dark. From time to time the faces of the mysterious
object reflected the brighter world behind Philip. He
reached for it and saw the distorted image of his hand on
the crystal surface. He took it and turned it around in his
hand. How was it floating in the air? How could it be so
shiny? Why such a strange shape? It could be better
examined in the sun&#8212;
<!--l. 459--><p class="indent" >   As Philip turned, he found himself facing a dark
creature. A spider spawn, full of legs and eyes, blocked
his way out of the cave. The adult spiders were even
larger than ants, but the youngling facing Philip was
shorter than a fairy.
<!--l. 463--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Thief,&#8221; it hissed and approached Philip. &#8220;You wanted
to steal my treasure. But I have caught you red handed.
And I have to prosecute you to the fullest extent of the
law.&#8221;
<!--l. 467--><p class="indent" >   The spider raised four legs menacingly and spread
them wide. But Philip was not so easy to scare. He
jumped on the spider, and they began to wrestle. The
eight long legs gave no advantage to the spider in close
combat. Philip&#8217;s momentum upended it and the legs
waved in the air in vain. Its mandibles snapped, but
Philip&#8217;s hands pinned its cephalothorax to the ground.
With yarn spun from its abdomen it tried to tie up
the wildly attacking fairy but had no luck. As the
wrestlers got entangled in more and more threads the
fight slowed down. Soon seven of the spider&#8217;s legs
were bound to Philip&#8217;s right ankle in a knot of yarn.
The end of the eighth leg was in Philip&#8217;s grip. The
spider looked up at the fairy with eight disheartened
eyes.
<!--l. 478--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I was just kidding,&#8221; it said. &#8220;You can have the
looking stone.&#8221;
<!--l. 480--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Philip said, and he caught the crystal
swinging on a thread. &#8220;I&#x00A0;am Philip, the explorer. What is
your name?&#8221;
<!--l. 483--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Greg, the cunning,&#8221; the spider spawn introduced
itself proudly and shook Philip&#8217;s hand with his foot.
&#8220;I&#x00A0;am practicing laying traps. You are my biggest quarry
so far.&#8221;
<!--l. 487--><p class="indent" >   Philip did not want to discourage the little spider. He
steered the conversation from the topic of the efficacy of
the trap.
<!--l. 490--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What does the looking stone do? Come, let us go out
to the sun and take a better look,&#8221; Philip said and walked
toward the exit of the cave with the spider still tied to his
foot. Greg tried to contribute to the walking with his one
free leg.
<!--l. 495--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;The looking stone is a very tiny grain of sand. The
curved surfaces distort what you see in a peculiar way.
When you look through it, everything is yellow, upside
down, and seems much closer than it really is,&#8221; the
bound spider spawn said. Philip raised the crystal to his
eyes and looked around from the bark of the trunk.
When he turned even a little, everything moved swiftly
in the stone. But once he learned to hold it very
carefully, the distant leaves seemed as if he were
standing on them. Just more yellow. And upside
down.
<!--l. 503--><p class="indent" >   Philip could not have enough of it. He turned the
looking stone from one leaf to the next. He watched
distant fairies, ants, spiders and parameciums. Looking
up, he found fairies who really lived at the bottom of a
leaf. They plastered the houses to the leaf, had to build
floors instead of roofs, and walked on yarns stretched
between their homes. Scanning along the branch, Philip
saw the toes of a giant bird and then the last leaves. And,
beyond the branch, another branch. Another tree.
Everything looked smaller there, and Philip could not tell
how fairies lived their lives on other trees. But he
could still spot larger animals there with the looking
stone.
<!--l. 513--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Look, Greg! Spiders live over there too! Do you
know them?&#8221; he asked his new friend. But in place of the
little spider there lay just a discarded pile of silk thread
now. The spider spawn had escaped while Philip admired
the looking stone. He could not find the spider in the
cave nor in the surrounding area. He carefully wrapped
the looking stone and put it in his backpack along with
the thread from his ankle. He continued on his way up,
hoping that Greg went the same way, and they would
meet again.
<!--l. 521--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 523--><p class="noindent" >   Further up, the easy climb through the fibers of the
bark was interrupted by a great hole. The bark had been
removed in an area the size of a small leaf. A deep fissure
opened into the body of the tree. Of course an explorer&#8217;s
job is to investigate mysterious places like this, so the
little fairy walked around the opening to find out
more.
<!--l. 529--><p class="indent" >   The chasm was deep, and Philip suspected the
woodpecker. He knew the sound of pecking. He learned
in school that that was how woodpeckers found the
tunnels that larvae dug in the wood. The fairies were
grateful to them for removing the pests of the tree
and also for not eating leaves. But it was a different
matter to hear about it and to stand alone in the great
crater.
<!--l. 535--><p class="indent" >   His suspicion was confirmed when he came upon the
wide mouth of a tunnel. The tunnel opened to the
left and to the right from the hole drilled by the
woodpecker. Philip reached the opening on the right. It
sloped upward while the opposite tunnel seemed to
descend. Did the woodpecker catch the larva? Or did it
scurry back into the tunnel and sneak away from the
bird?
<!--l. 541--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Hello,&#8221; Philip called into the cool gloom of the
tunnel, but only the echo replied. He set out to explore
the passage.
<!--l. 544--><p class="indent" >   The slight initial slope gradually turned steeper. In
the vertical spans Philip had to climb skillfully because
the tunnel wall was much smoother than the bark.
But he could also move faster because he did not
have to search for a path or avoid protists hiding in
droplets.
<!--l. 549--><p class="indent" >   As he got further from the hole made by the
woodpecker, it turned darker and quieter. A steady
breeze filled the shaft, which thankfully pulled Philip up
and made his progress easier. The little fairy knew it
meant an exit was waiting at the end of the tunnel.
<!--l. 554--><p class="indent" >   The darkness was not yet complete when the tunnel
started getting brighter again. The weak light had a
yellow tint, as if it had entered the tunnel through the
looking stone. The light was growing stronger until
Philip reached its source. The light of the sun filtered
through the wall of the tunnel. Thin plates of wood lent
it their yellowish color. At the center of the ring of light
was a hole the size of a fairy. The draft left the tunnel
through this hole.
<!--l. 562--><p class="indent" >   A strange scene awaited little Philip in the yellow
glow. An ant stood opposite the radiant gate. It stood not
on six legs, like normal ants did, but on two, like a fairy
did. The other two pairs of legs were clasped in front of
its body, as if it were praying in the alcove of the tunnel.
Peculiar designs covered the walls of the tiny shrine. The
ant must have had carved the lines into the polished
wood.
<!--l. 569--><p class="indent" >   Philip sat down at the entrance of the shrine and
watched the silent ant in awe. He could not figure out
what the lines meant and was eagerly hoping the ant
would explain when it woke up. He got hungry from the
long climb and unpacked two lovely balls of pollen to
pass the time usefully. His hands also found the looking
stone. Close up, however, the ant looked like an endless
golden statue. Flipping the stone around pushed
everything into the distance. The unwrapped pollen
seemed unreachable. But Philip&#8217;s hand also stretched like
a spider&#8217;s thread and fetched a remote morsel to his
mouth.
<!--l. 578--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 580--><p class="noindent" >   Ants do not blink. Their eyes are covered with thin
chitin. They do not need moisture. Philip did not know if
the ant was watching or asleep. He had barely finished
the first pollen when movement caught his eye. The ant
spread its middle pair of legs, then the top pair, then
froze into this new pose.
<!--l. 585--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Would you like some pollen?&#8221; Philip asked and
offered the second ball to the ant. &#8220;Do you live here?
Were you banished from the empire? What did you
invent? These carvings are beautiful. Were they the
reason?&#8221;
<!--l. 589--><p class="indent" >   The ant did not respond but accepted the tiny snack
with a slow movement. It brought the pollen leisurely to
its mouth and ate it.
<!--l. 592--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Do you know any other exiles? What things have
you invented? Will you teach me too?&#8221; Philip saw a
secret ant city built at the top of the tree in his mind&#8217;s
eye. This mythical place would have been the prize of
his expedition. All he wanted to hear was the ant
acknowledge its existence.
<!--l. 597--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I found the truth. The light. This is the shrine of
radiance. The sun is the source of all life,&#8221; the ant
replied. &#8220;The empire of the ants would be lost without
the rays of the sun as well. And yet they cast me away.
They did not want to build the temple of the sun. I have
to do the work on my own.&#8221;
<!--l. 602--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I am happy to help!&#8221; Philip suggested.
<!--l. 604--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;The sun is waiting for us at the top of the tree. But I
cannot go any further. Please, take this song to the top of
the tree.&#8221;

<!--l. 613--><p class="indent" >   Philip recorded the song in his diary and said
goodbye to the ant.
<!--l. 615--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 617--><p class="noindent" >   Philip had to squint as he crossed the gate of the dim
shrine and walked out onto the sunny bark. He was high
up in the tree, much closer to the sun than Dewington.
The pollen had filled him with satisfaction. So had the
old ant speaking about the top of the tree. He rose
toward his goal with light strides.
<!--l. 622--><p class="indent" >   The merry walk ended abruptly when Philip slipped
and fell on his back. As he got on his feet his fingers felt
strange slimy forms. Everything around him was teeming
with yellow bacteria. They were squirming across the
tree bark, spreading their slippery mucus over it. They
surrounded Philip and nudged his shoes with their noses.
Kicking the fingerlings out of his way he retreated to
the dry part of the bark. Looking up, he saw that
the germs covered most of the way up. They used
the slippery mucus to extract nutrients from the
bark. Philip did not feel a rash on his skin, so the
mucus had not been dangerous. On flat ground he
would have carefully cut across the field of bacteria.
But it was too dangerous to continue the climb like
this.
<!--l. 633--><p class="indent" >   Philip looked for another route. Due to the curvature
of the trunk he could not see how far the bacterium
colony extended. But he saw a thick branch level with
the ant&#8217;s shrine. After climbing onto this branch he was
better able to assess the situation. The bacteria had not
infested the area by accident. Above them was the
nesting hole of the woodpeckers, and the slimy microbes
lived off of their waste. He could not see how much of
the other side of the trunk the unnavigable field
covered. But Philip would rather not risk the trip. The
yellow bacteria were harmless, but he knew that
more dangerous varieties could also be living in the
area.
<!--l. 643--><p class="indent" >   Deep in thought he walked on along the branch. As
he got further from the trunk he got a better picture of
the layout of branches. If he could somehow get from
one branch to another, he could keep his distance from
the woodpeckers and continue his journey to the
top.
<!--l. 648--><p class="indent" >   Philip stumbled again and fell forward this time. The
sound of a string plucked filled the air. It still hummed
when the fairy got back on his feet and started looking
for the invisible obstacle that had tripped him. He found
it by the sound and the vibration. A clear yarn the
thickness of a fairy&#8217;s finger was fastened to the branch.
The yarn rose into the air at an angle. No matter how
Philip squinted he was unable to make out the other end
of the fine strand. He hoped that it might be a way to a
higher tree branch.
<!--l. 656--><p class="indent" >   In his mind he extended the line of the string and
tried to guess which branch the other end might be tied
to. Halfway to the next branch, however, he spotted
something on the imaginary line. A huge black spider
seemed to float in the air. Its legs worked the fine
yarn, and before Philip could tell whether the spider
was coming or going it was already standing above
him.
<!--l. 662--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Well, well, look what my web has caught,&#8221; the spider
droned as it towered above Philip. &#8220;If it is not one crafty
fairy!&#8221;
<!--l. 665--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I am sorry, I did not see your web. I am Philip,&#8221; he
started his introduction.
<!--l. 668--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;The explorer. Yes, I know. Playmate of Gregory. I am
his mom. Should I ask him if he wants to come down and
play?&#8221;
<!--l. 671--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Thank you. But the truth is I would rather go up.
Where does this thread lead? Can I get to the next
branch this way?&#8221;
<!--l. 674--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Of course! You are very welcome to use our web,
free of charge. I can also offer you an inexpensive map if
you need one,&#8221; the spider said slyly.
<!--l. 677--><p class="indent" >   Philip knew the story of John. The fairy knight went
to fight an evil spider who exploited the inhabitants of
the leaf. After a long journey he found the web of
the spider and started to climb. The spider saw his
fearsome sword and fled to the other side of the web.
John chased after it and deftly climbed the yarns of
the web. But the spider always avoided him and
the web became ever stickier under John. Only the
spider knew which thread was sticky and which was
safe.
<!--l. 685--><p class="indent" >   In the story John cut off the web with his sword and
chased the spider out of the tree. But Philip had no
sword nor did he want to cut off the web.
<!--l. 688--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What would you ask in return for the map?&#8221; he
asked.
<!--l. 690--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Knowledge for knowledge,&#8221; the spider mom replied.
&#8220;Teach me how to knit a nice jacket like yours. I have a
lot of yarn and would love to make a winter coat
for Gregory. But I do not know the first thing about
knitting.&#8221;
<!--l. 694--><p class="indent" >   So it came to pass that Philip taught the spider to
knit.
<!--l. 696--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 698--><p class="noindent" >   Once the spider had learned enough, she started
knitting a simple square cloth. She wove an intricate
pattern from three alternating fibers. Line by line her
work revealed a map of the web to Philip. Seven long
threads anchored the web to various branches. Radial
fibers stretched between them, and a dense spiral of
sticky threads covered them. A network of walkways
allowed the spiders to get around without getting
stuck.
<!--l. 705--><p class="indent" >   The map of the secret walkways was very useful. But
Philip&#8217;s attention was drawn to something else. The
spider had embroidered detailed pictograms at the
seven anchor points. Philip recognized only some
of them. A woodpecker was peeking out of a hole
where he had met the spider. An aphid was grazing
at another anchor at the same height. At the other
end of the thread a fairy was smiling. To the left a
squirrel was chewing on something at the anchor of the
web.
<!--l. 713--><p class="indent" >   Philip&#8217;s eyes gleamed as the spider knitted the
map. He had not even dreamed of so many things
to explore. A whole day would not be enough to
uncover all these secrets. He had to decide which one
of the threads to leave the web by first. The top of
the tree was still the destination of the expedition,
so he chose a yarn leading high up, to the smiling
fairy.
<!--l. 719--><p class="indent" >   Philip was no spider and one branch was far from
the next. Greg accompanied him for a span, but
the climb still felt endless. Gradually, however, he
began to suspect where the thread led. It was not
fastened to the bark of a branch like the anchor at the
woodpeckers was, but to the bottom of a leaf. And as he
came closer, he saw it was not fastened at a single
point either. On approach the thread unwound into
three fibers and ran to three different sites on the
leaf. Philip chose the one closest to the tip of the
leaf.
<!--l. 727--><p class="indent" >   When he got close enough to see the fairy buildings,
a busy city spread out ahead of him. As seen through the
looking stone, the inhabitants built their homes on the
bottom of the leaf. Garish floorings adorned the bottoms
of the houses. Terraces with colorful fences and the
hanging bridges between them served as streets for the
fairies of the city. Thin threads connected one porch to
another across distances great and small for sending
messages and getting around. Philip also noted an
interesting method of freight transport. From time
to time big packages swung through the air from
one end of the leaf to the other on threads of silk.
Fearless fairies stood upon them and guided the
shipments to their destinations by leaning against the
thread.
<!--l. 738--><p class="indent" >   The spider thread on which Philip climbed led
inside a large building. The atrium around the thread
connected three floors. On each floor planks reached out
to the thread to make getting on and off easier. As Philip
stepped on the plank of the first floor, exhausted
from the climb, he found himself right inside a busy
warehouse. An army of strong fairies filled the floor.
They carried large bales over their heads and directed
the loading process through loud jabber.
<!--l. 746--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Where are the rest of the algae?&#8221; someone called
down from the second floor. &#8220;Hey, little fairy! Go ask
which storeroom they put the algae in! We&#8217;ve got to ship
them to grand central.&#8221;
<!--l. 750--><p class="indent" >   There was no such organized trade in Dewington, but
Philip was used to conveying messages between
adults. He ran among the stevedores and asked where
they took the algae. They took them to storeroom
three.
<!--l. 754--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;They took them to storeroom three!&#8221; Philip shouted
upstairs.
<!--l. 756--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Why not to number two?!&#8221; the fairy upstairs
grumbled. &#8220;All the same in the end. Let the cranksmen in
the loft know they can get started. We cannot wait any
longer.&#8221;
<!--l. 760--><p class="indent" >   Philip did not understand much of this, but he
grabbed the spider silk from the plank and climbed up to
the top floor. The end of the thread was not fastened to
the surface of the leaf. It wound around a big reel
instead, thickly covering the axle. A large wheel was
attached to the axle and could be pulled by many fairies
from both sides of the floor.
<!--l. 766--><p class="indent" >   Philip landed on the plank of the loft and conveyed
the message to the idle workers. They sprang into action
at once and eagerly started turning the big wheel.
The spider silk stretched and twisted around the
reel. Up close, it seemed as if they were pulling the
web closer to themselves. But Philip realized that
the web was not moving. As the thread shortened,
the leaf itself swung into motion. With each turn
of the wheel the entire leaf, the entire city bent a
little.
<!--l. 774--><p class="indent" >   Philip was impressed by the legion of workers and the
stream of goods their hands unloaded. He helped out for
a while in the silk docks. He got to know the local
fairies and the history of the leaf in the short breaks
between loading and unloading. They collaborated with
Greg&#8217;s family and had built a trading network along
the silk threads. The spider family supplied them
with plenty of silk and assisted in setting up the
system of reels. In exchange, the fairies offered special
delicacies, spices, news, and colored crystals to the
spiders.
<!--l. 782--><p class="indent" >   At the end of the shift the workers invited Philip to
lunch. After a hearty meal they produced their greatest
pride, the spider brandy. Philip had not heard of it in
Dewington. Seeing his interest, the locals started on a
detailed explanation. Those with eight legs and those
with two enjoyed this distillate equally. Golden dewdrops
condensed at dawn on the bottom of the leaf and of the
fairy buildings. Teams of fairies collected the tiny
droplets into large barrels using safety harnesses and
agility worthy of spiders. The heady beads were then
stowed in casks and tapped whenever the fairies
gathered and danced together.
<!--l. 792--><p class="indent" >   Their best kept secret was the origin of the golden
droplets. The spirit rose to the leaf dissolved in warm air.
The touch of the cool surface forced it into a liquid form.
The air was warm from the light of the new sun and
lifted off of a leaf on the branch below. Upon this leaf the
fairies had put a herd of gentle aphids to pasture. The
aphids produced honeydew, and the fairies fermented a
part of it with the help of a fungus. The heat of the
rising sun evaporated the spirits from the fermented
droplets, and these spirits ended up in the barrels of the
city.
<!--l. 801--><p class="indent" >   Philip did not try it, but was told that it tasted like
sunlight. After a sip the fairies would feel like they
were basking in the summer sun. Their city was
named after this beverage. Solperla, he learned from
the locals, meant &#8220;pearls of the sun&#8221; in a foreign
language.
<!--l. 806--><p class="indent" >   The spirit was round and yellow and could be ignited
by a spark. It would give off light and heat then and
could burn a careless hand. A round black spot, not
unlike the dry Stain of Dewington, marked the invention
of fire in Solperla. The fairies had mastered the use of
fire since then. At night a tiny flame always flickered
below the city. The light helped travelers find their
way home and drew many unwary insects into the
spiders&#8217; web. The spiders mistrusted the dangerous
beacon at first, but the rich harvest had soon convinced
them.
<!--l. 815--><p class="indent" >   Philip said thanks for his lunch and for the interesting
stories, and headed off to explore Solperla. He welcomed
the change of pace after the flurry of the docks. He
walked through the bridges of the city and looked down
on the leaves below. He knew one of the leaves had to be
Dewington. But even with the looking stone he found it
impossible to find where he had set off on his journey in
the morning.
<!--l. 822--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 824--><p class="noindent" >   Philip soon found himself playing tag with a flock of
Solperlan children. The game took more skill than in
Dewington. Even the smallest fairies knew all the
bridges and stray threads. They walked across silk
fibers, swung on threads hanging from terraces, and
every time they appeared to dive into the deep, they
caught on to a ledge or overhanging fabric at the last
moment.
<!--l. 830--><p class="indent" >   Philip could barely navigate the maze of suspension
bridges, so he often got to be &#8220;it&#8221;. At one time he was
chasing an older playmate. The boy gained distance
through a series of unexpected shortcuts, but Philip did
not give up the pursuit. They were heading for the
stem of the leaf, and he knew that the labyrinth
that was Solperla would come to an end there. The
network of swinging bridges, terraces, and spider silk
woven between them was running out ahead of the
boys. Nowhere to run, Philip tagged him with a good
lunge.
<!--l. 838--><p class="indent" >   The crowd of local children had been right on their
heels. They scattered screaming as the new &#8220;it&#8221; turned
around and started after them. Philip was left alone at
the edge of Solperla. The wild pace of the chase still
pounded in his ears. But his eyes turned to the stem of
the leaf, and his heart settled down. If he wanted to get
to the top of the tree and get back to Dewington
before dinner, he could not spend any more time
playing.
<!--l. 845--><p class="indent" >   At this altitude the trunk was growing thinner
and the horizontal branches were getting shorter.
The bark was also younger and smoother. The tiny
hands of a fairy could still find a hold, of course. The
smoother and younger surface just meant that Philip
did not have to worry about germs lurking in dark
cavities.
<!--l. 850--><p class="indent" >   With each passing branch and twig the foliage above
him grew thinner, until at last the trunk ran out. Two leaf
stalks grew at the end, and he started to climb the one
that led to the higher leaf.
<!--l. 854--><p class="indent" >   Philip saw nothing of note from below, but he
knew something exciting must wait for him on the
other side. It was impossible that he would not find
something special on the very highest leaf of the entire
tree. Perhaps the magical city of outcast ants would
be revealed? Or the sun itself lived up there in a
glowing palace? In his court a bustle of fairies would
walk around in strange dresses, important papers
in their hands, and they would have no time for
Philip?
<!--l. 862--><p class="indent" >   When he came level with the leaf, he counted
to three. Then, ready for anything, he jumped on
top.
<!--l. 865--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 867--><p class="noindent" >   The top leaf was more slanted than the rest, and
Philip almost tumbled right back from it. He regained
his balance, but found nothing exciting other than
that. The immaculate green leaf was completely
barren. Walking through the central vein, he could
have as well been walking down the main street of
Dewington in the early spring, before the fairies had
arrived.
<!--l. 873--><p class="indent" >   It felt good to stretch out on the soft warm surface
after the long climb. It felt good to cartwheel and roll
down the main street. And it felt good to run around in
circles. Half a circle down the slope, half a circle up the
slope. It felt good to climb to the tip of the leaf too,
where his father and mother would have awaited him,
had this leaf been Dewington. And at last it felt good to
look at the whole wide world from the highest point of
the tree.
<!--l. 880--><p class="indent" >   He had seen distant leaves from the window of his
own room. He knew the most remote ones grew
from branches of a different tree. He knew that birds
flew from one branch to another and could fly from
tree to tree as well. But all that did not prepare him
for the sight of the forest. Philip&#8217;s tree stood in the
side of a large hill with great view of the rolling
landscape. An infinitude of trees covered the hills.
There were more trees in the forest than leaves on
a tree. The tree was finite, but the forest seemed
boundless.
<!--l. 888--><p class="indent" >   And every tree was different. One was taller, the
other shorter. Some had berries, others had cones. Even
their leaves were not all the same. Philip looked in awe
and tried to imagine what life might be like on the oddly
shaped leaves. Some were round, while some had three
or five tips. Many leaves were larger than Dewington.
But many were less green than those on Philip&#8217;s
tree. The autumn seemed to have arrived already on
other leaves. The rolling hills were shining yellow,
red, and brown, matching the hues of the clouds
in the west. The sun was setting behind them. Its
faint disc reminded Philip of the song of the old
ant.

<!--l. 904--><p class="indent" >   The song teased the sun out from behind the clouds,
and it flooded the hills with golden light. A lark flew up
from a nearby tree and called its playmates with a sharp
squeak. Some did join it in flight, and they danced
together in the sky. Others joined them in song. But all of
a sudden they all vanished.
<!--l. 909--><p class="indent" >   Philip lifted his hand to his eyes and looked between
his fingers toward the distant hills. A second sun was
rising from behind the horizon. Its flickering light
seemed to set fire to the colorful slopes. The dark clouds
became shadows. The song of birds dwindled. Every
creature in the forest was watching the awesome
sight.
<!--l. 915--><p class="indent" >   The blinding light rose higher in the sky, and soon a
deep rumble filled the landscape. Philip watched it lying
down on the leaf. As the rumbling sound grew louder
and louder, he was frightened to see that a wave was
sweeping through the forest. The trees bowed in its way.
Their yellowed leaves were cast high. Flocks of birds
took flight in panic. The wave rolled out from the new
sun through the landscape and relentlessly headed
toward Philip.
<!--l. 922--><p class="indent" >   Philip did not exactly know what was going on, but
his instincts put an end to placid observation. Without
thinking he jumped up and ran. Away from the tip of the
highest leaf, away from the path of the wave tearing
everything up. He ran down the barren main street of the
leaf, slid down the smooth stalk and held on to the
unyielding bark of the trunk. And then the wave
hit.
<!--l. 928--><p class="indent" >   The whole tree shook from a dreadful thunder. The
air filled with whirling grains of sand. Entire leaves
tumbled among them, and Philip could even see twigs
torn off as a whole. A bird was escaping the bustle, but
unpredictably writhing branches got in its way. Philip
held on to small cracks on the bark with all his might
and hoped to see his family again.
<!--l. 934--><p class="indent" >   Sand grains the size of a fairy tore at the branch
around him. A brown leaf covered him and blotted out
the glare for a moment, but then the wind carried it on
and tried to take Philip along. Tiny droplets of mist
peppered around him, and the landscape swung into
motion as the trunk bent. Something grabbed Philip, and
they tumbled into the void together.
<!--l. 940--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 942--><p class="noindent" >   Fortunately, Philip had clung to the bark through the
worst of the blast, so when he tumbled they fell straight
down. They whooshed past a branch, then the next one
generously extended a leaf in their way. Head over heels
they landed on the surface in a heap. The world revolved
around them until the trembling of the leaf slowly
subsided.
<!--l. 948--><p class="indent" >   Philip sat up, and an old blue fairy sat up against
him.
<!--l. 950--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Oh, my, where may I be,&#8221; said the blue-skinned lady.
She straightened out her fine clothes and put a strand of
hair back into the tangle on her head.
<!--l. 953--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Thank you for helping me land here, little fairy,&#8221; she
thanked Philip. &#8220;That&#8217;s strange weather, is it not? We&#8217;d
better go look for your parents and make you a nice cup
of tea. You have paled entirely, I see the blue has drained
right out of your face.&#8221;
<!--l. 958--><p class="indent" >   Philip felt his face in surprise. Indeed, it was not blue,
but it was not usually blue.
<!--l. 961--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I am Philip, the explorer,&#8221; he blurted out for lack of
something better.
<!--l. 963--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Oh, such a very nice name. I am Raisy. Which leaf
did you leave for your expedition, Philip? I think we have
seen it all now and it is time for a rest.&#8221;
<!--l. 967--><p class="indent" >   Philip agreed with her. As soon as the tree settled
down, they started their journey toward Dewington.
<!--l. 970--><p class="indent" >   Raisy was as small as Philip, despite being older than
even the adults. And she was very blue. The wind flew
her off of a distant tree, and she said everyone was blue
there. She knew a lot about the forest, and even knew
that the new sun that rose so violently was called a
rocket. Its grumble had faded by then, and when they
spotted it high above the canopy, its brilliant flame had
shrunk to a pinpoint.
<!--l. 977--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;How are you going to go home, Raisy?&#8221; Philip asked.
&#8220;Maybe you could jump from a very long branch
to a neighboring tree, but the journey would take
days.&#8221;
<!--l. 981--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Weeks,&#8221; Raisy corrected him. &#8220;The autumn is
knocking on our doors. We cannot go on such long
journeys now. There is nothing to eat on the withered
leaves, and they will all turn brown before I would get
home. I will have to move in with your family, Philip,
unless&#8212;&#8221;
<!--l. 986--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Unless we build a rocket!&#8221; Philip suggested.
<!--l. 988--><p class="indent" >   Raisy came from an evergreen tree, where the leaves
were narrow needles, and the fairies dug their homes
into them. The homes were connected by long winding
staircases, but their children came and went through the
windows too. The sticky resin of their tree did not
freeze in the winter, and their excellent engineers
had found a way to heat the apartments. Raisy too
was an engineer, and while she had never heard of
fairies building a rocket, she did not consider it to be
impossible.
<!--l. 996--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;The most important issue is fuel. If something burns
fast, it also evaporates fast, so it will not be easy to find it
in nature,&#8221; contemplated Raisy.
<!--l. 999--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I know exactly where we can get fuel!&#8221; Philip said
and slid down the stem of the leaf.
<!--l. 1002--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 1004--><p class="noindent" >   Philip waited for Raisy at the base of the stalk, but it
appeared that the elder fairy had chosen a more cautious
way of descent. He watched through the looking stone as
she started off carefully. But the leaves were different
from the needles of the blue fairies, and Raisy did not
fare well on the waxy surface. She tumbled a bit,
grabbed the stem again, climbed a little, rolled down,
then held on and continued climbing. It did not take long
before her erratic descent ended with Raisy hanging on
her long blue scarf from the stem. Philip started
to climb back up to help her but had not made it
half of the way when he heard Raisy scream. His
companion&#8217;s scarf had slipped off the stem and was
trailing behind the falling fairy. Philip had decide in a
heartbeat. He decided to jump from the stem, grab
Raisy mid-flight, and plummet together for a second
time.
<!--l. 1017--><p class="indent" >   Her long scarf slowed down their descent, but also
made it unpredictable. The rocket&#8217;s rumble was a barely
audible murmur by now, but the air had not fully
settled yet and took the two fairies for a spin. They
looped around the leaf stem, sped by the branch,
made two loops below it, rose a little, then fell again
spinning.
<!--l. 1023--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Great fun, is it not, Philip?&#8221; Raisy screamed over the
sound of the air rushing past them.
<!--l. 1026--><p class="indent" >   The world looped around them a few more times
then came to an abrupt halt. The blue scarf froze in the
air, as if caught by invisible hands. The fairies had ended
up on a sticky line of spider silk.
<!--l. 1030--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Watch out, Philip, it&#8217;s a spider!&#8221; cried the little blue
elf. &#8220;We must get out! We have to break free! If the spider
gets here we are done for!&#8221;
<!--l. 1033--><p class="indent" >   Raisy struggled desperately, but to no avail. But her
panicked efforts attracted the attention of the spider. The
big black body was walking to them across an invisible
thread.
<!--l. 1037--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;It is good to see you again, Philip,&#8221; said the spider.
&#8220;I&#x00A0;was very worried about you. What a gust! Fairies were
falling into my web like raindrops, I could barely keep
freeing them. Fortunately, I caught a nice big bug too,&#8221;
she giggled.
<!--l. 1042--><p class="indent" >   The terror on Raisy&#8217;s face turned into incomprehension,
then disbelief, and finally a wide smile.
<!--l. 1045--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;This is Raisy,&#8221; Philip introduced her. &#8220;The wind blew
her here from an evergreen tree.&#8221;
<!--l. 1048--><p class="indent" >   Raisy found her voice and greeted the spider warmly.
It turned out that fairy-eating spiders lived on her tree,
and it was extremely dangerous to fall into their
webs.
<!--l. 1052--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Of course, friendship is much better,&#8221; added Raisy, a
little embarrassed. She was not keen to give the spider
new diet ideas.
<!--l. 1055--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I agree wholeheartedly,&#8221; said Greg&#8217;s mother, &#8220;and
fairies are not tasty anyway.&#8221;
<!--l. 1058--><p class="indent" >   After freeing both of them from the sticky silk she
showed them Greg&#8217;s half-finished coat. They had a nice
chat about the subtleties of knitting, and the spider even
offered Raisy some brandy.
<!--l. 1062--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;A lot of barrels fell into my web from Solperla. They
left them behind to thank me for to rescuing the fairies
from the web. Here&#8217;s to the great luck that we all
survived this whirlwind!&#8221;
<!--l. 1066--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Good stuff,&#8221; said Raisy with a click of her tongue.
&#8220;This will make an excellent fuel for the rocket.&#8221;
<!--l. 1069--><p class="indent" >   The spider said she would never consume so many
barrels, and offered a deal to the fairies. They could have
all of the fuel in exchange for tying a silk thread to the
rocket. The spider could then walk to the faraway tree.
And if commerce began between the two fairy peoples,
she could levy a tax.
<!--l. 1074--><p class="indent" >   The two fairies were enthusiastic. They accepted the
offer and received eleven barrels of spider brandy. As
they arrived at the bottom of the web, Raisy asked for
the looking stone and the travel journal and started to
measure and calculate. How far was the evergreen tree?
What was the best arc for the flight? How much did a
fairy weigh, and how many barrels of brandy would they
need?
<!--l. 1081--><p class="indent" >   Philip followed along at first, but then his attention
drifted. Something was moving on the surface of the
branch in the distance. He asked for the looking stone so
he could get a better look, but Raisy would not give it up.
He tried to gain a better view by hanging from the web.
He stuck his ear to the bark to see if he could hear
footsteps. Something small and furry was riding toward
them.
<!--l. 1088--><p class="indent" >   A few moments later he was running circles around
Raisy with Babouche in tow. The paramecium had
tracked him down somehow, and Philip was very glad for
the company. Chasing one another was much more
exciting than following the complex calculations. Mary
soon appeared on the horizon as well. Babouche ran
from Philip to Mary and from Mary to Philip until the
fairy boy and fairy girl reached each other.
<!--l. 1095--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;There you are, Philip,&#8221; Mary rejoiced. &#8220;Everyone in
Dewington is worried for you. Good thing you were
not at the top of the tree when the wind picked up
everything! We would have to haul you back from the far
end of the forest.&#8221;
<!--l. 1099--><p class="indent" >   Philip was happy to see Mary too. He told her that he
was actually right at the top when the blast from
the rocket reached the tree. And he also told her
what a rocket was and introduced Raisy, who flashed
a smile at Mary but did not stop working on her
calculations.
<!--l. 1104--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;And this is our rocket fuel,&#8221; he pointed at the
eleven barrels of brandy at the base of the spider
web.
<!--l. 1107--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 1109--><p class="noindent" >   &#8220;Are you crazy? If a rocket that far from us created
such a big wind, then yours will tear the tree from the
ground,&#8221; Mary said.
<!--l. 1112--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Oh, Philip, you are scaring Mary,&#8221; Raisy interjected.
&#8220;That distant rocket was loaded with more barrels of fuel
than there are leaves in the forest. Our rocket will only
have a hundred barrels.&#8221;
<!--l. 1116--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;One hundred barrels?&#8221; Philip asked, surprised. &#8220;But
we only got eleven barrels from the spider.&#8221;
<!--l. 1119--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I know, Philip. Unfortunately, it appears we will need
to find eighty-nine more barrels.&#8221;
<!--l. 1122--><p class="indent" >   They climbed up to Solperla. Many bridges hung
broken, and the colorful fences were torn by the
wind. One of the homes had almost separated from
the bottom of the leaf, and they watched a team
of fairies rescue the residents and try to pull the
collapsed house back in place with ropes. One dock
worker got stranded on the swinging freight transport
line and looked up at the city anxiously. The strong
building of the docks was thankfully unharmed, but
hundreds of boxes and casks had rolled out from the
storerooms inside, and workers were busy restoring
order.
<!--l. 1131--><p class="indent" >   Raisy, Mary, and Philip helped sort the contents of a
warehouse and learned of the damages the city had
suffered. The fairies were accustomed to unexpected
gusts, and most were able to hold on to something.
Those who fell were brought back by the spider.
But unfortunately, the barrels of brandy all broke
free, rolled out of the stores and fell into the depths.
There was one unfinished barrel in the foreman&#8217;s
room, and he gave it to Philip in return for their
help.
<!--l. 1139--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;If this goes on, we will not have one hundred barrels
by spring,&#8221; Mary lamented. &#8220;And I was starting to look
forward to traveling in a rocket.&#8221;
<!--l. 1142--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;If Solperla has lost its stock of brandy,&#8221; Philip
thought aloud, &#8220;the surest way is if we distill it ourselves
from fermented honeydew. There is a leaf under
Solperla, where the aphids are put to pasture. Maybe
they can give us honeydew.&#8221;
<!--l. 1147--><p class="indent" >   The small party descended to the leaf below the city
to assess the reserves there.
<!--l. 1150--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I am telling you I will sprout four more limbs, if we
spend the whole day climbing up and down on the
spider&#8217;s web,&#8221; said Raisy as they arrived on the leaf.
Philip and Mary were ahead of her, pushing their way
through between the legs of a crowd of fairies. Raisy
followed them.
<!--l. 1155--><p class="indent" >   The fairies stood in a ring around a raging aphid. The
insect was smaller than an ant, but still towered over the
fairies. They all held thin ropes of spider silk and
tried to keep the unruly beast in the center of the
circle. The aphid neighed and tried to cast off the
ropes, but a brave fairy climbed onto its back, tied its
antennae together, and tried to subdue it. A young
fairy quickly ushered Mary and Philip out of the
circle.
<!--l. 1162--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Take care, my dears,&#8221; she said while leading them
from the circle of fairies wrestling the beast. &#8220;Someone
could trample you. What is going on here, you ask?
Aphids are usually very gentle animals, but they go wild
when separated from the flock. Unfortunately, the flock
broke out of the pen when the wind bent the tree.
This poor calf fell behind, and my sister lassoed it
by the trunk. A dozen strong fairies helped her to
bring it back. Not much longer until it calms down
now.&#8221;
<!--l. 1170--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What will become of us, Judy?&#8221; an older boy asked
her. &#8220;Without the flock we will not have anything to eat.
What will we do when the winter comes?&#8221;
<!--l. 1173--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;All year we were preparing for the winter. The
pantry is full,&#8221; Judy reassured him. &#8220;But we will have to
tighten our belts in the spring if this calf is going to be
grazing on the leaf all by itself.&#8221;
<!--l. 1177--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I am Philip, the explorer,&#8221; said Philip timidly. &#8220;Maybe
we can help you find the stray flock.&#8221;
<!--l. 1180--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Where are you from, Philip?&#8221; asked Judy.
<!--l. 1182--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I am from Dewington.&#8221;
<!--l. 1184--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;So you live in the ant kingdom. Then you should
know that the ants will capture the herd before sunset,
and no matter how much we ask, they will not give it
back. They will not answer, and you will not even know
whether they see you.&#8221;
<!--l. 1189--><p class="indent" >   Philip knew the ants saw him, and Tony might even
answer him. But he knew Judy was right, the ants would
never return the flock of aphids. Then he remembered
the old ant who worshipped the sun, and hoped that
maybe he can offer them advice.
<!--l. 1194--><p class="indent" >   Once more they set off on the spider&#8217;s web. Mary
broke the silence of the climb.
<!--l. 1197--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What if we cannot find more fuel? Are we going to
dilute these twelve barrels? Or ask the fairies of the
evergreen tree to send us some more? Or just play
something else?&#8221;
<!--l. 1201--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;But we are only eighty-eight barrels short,&#8221; said
Philip. &#8220;I&#x00A0;am sure the old ant will help. The fuel is
almost ready for the launch.&#8221;
<!--l. 1204--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Roger that, Captain Philip! And what else do we
need for the rocket?&#8221; She turned to Raisy now.
<!--l. 1207--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;We need a house with strong walls, in which we are
going to fly. We need to attach wings to it, so we can
steer, and we need a nozzle,&#8221; Raisy listed.
<!--l. 1210--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;A nuzzle?&#8221; Mary asked. &#8220;For what?&#8221;
<!--l. 1212--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;When the fuel is ignited, its flame goes every which
way. We need to set it on fire in a space such that the
flame can only go backward. Then it will push us
forward,&#8221; the blue fairy explained. &#8220;The nozzle is a
special tube with one narrow mouth, where the fuel
trickles in, and one wide mouth, where the flame comes
out.&#8221;
<!--l. 1218--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;But in Solperla they said the flame burns everything,&#8221;
said Philip thoughtfully. &#8220;Will it not burn the nozzle?&#8221;
<!--l. 1221--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I too heard a story from my grandmother,&#8221; Mary
said, &#8220;in which the spider catches John and breathes fire
upon him.&#8221;
<!--l. 1224--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Now that is really something,&#8221; Raisy gasped. &#8220;A
fire-breathing spider? Maybe it drank too much brandy?
And what did it spin its web from so that it would not
burn?&#8221;
<!--l. 1228--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;That is the point,&#8221; Mary said. &#8220;The web burned, the
leaves burned, the whole tree burned, and even the earth
blackened. In the end, in the midst of the soot and
blackness there was only John left standing against the
spider.&#8221;
<!--l. 1232--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;How come they did not burn?&#8221; Philip asked. &#8220;Are
you suggesting we ought to make the nozzle from fairies
or spiders?&#8221;
<!--l. 1235--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;They did not burn,&#8221; Mary explained, &#8220;so that the
story could continue. But the earth they stood on
did not burn either. Let us make the nozzle out of
earth!&#8221;
<!--l. 1239--><p class="indent" >   No one could argue with this line of reasoning, so
they agreed on the plan. Philip&#8217;s task would be filling the
brandy reserves. Raisy would build the hull of the rocket.
Mary would create a nozzle from earth. For a while
longer, however, they travelled together, carrying the
barrels from the spider web. They marched on the
branch to the trunk, each balancing four barrels above
their heads. Along the way Raisy told the children
stories of the family she had left on the coniferous
tree.
<!--l. 1247--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 1249--><p class="noindent" >   &#8220;And my oldest grandson is called Robert,&#8221; Raisy
completed the list. &#8220;He is about as big as you are, Philip!
I wonder what he might be up to at this moment.&#8221;
<!--l. 1253--><p class="indent" >   While Raisy told them about her grandchildren, they
arrived at the gate of the ant&#8217;s sanctuary and unloaded
the heavy barrels.
<!--l. 1256--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I cannot wait for you to meet them, Mary! You will
get along splendidly. Come, let us see what Philip&#8217;s ant
friend can tell us!&#8221; she said, and they all stepped through
the ornate gate.
<!--l. 1260--><p class="indent" >   A wondrous golden glow still filled the sanctuary, and
tiny specks of light swirled in the scented air. Although
there were three of them now, the silence seemed even
deeper than when Philip had visited alone. Raisy hugged
the kids and they watched the ant for a long time
without saying a word. Surrounded by the wood
carvings, the ant touched its top limbs together in prayer.
Nothing moved but the shadows of the leaves swaying in
the light that shined through the gate. But the leaves
were very far and their ever-changing shadows danced in
vain on the ant&#8217;s armor. The guardian of the sanctuary
was dead. Long stalks of golden spears had pierced its
forehead and shoulders. Yellow daggers emerged from its
legs as well.
<!--l. 1271--><p class="indent" >   A yellow shard fell down and broke the fairies&#8217; daze.
The shard was as big as Philip&#8217;s arm, and dropped to the
floor with a puff of golden dust. Raisy was hesitant to let
go of the fairy boy&#8217;s hand, but a moment later Philip was
picking up the strange fragment. It was very light, but
seemed strong too. Its surface was covered with a
thousand holes, as if someone had tried to imitate the
ant&#8217;s carvings. As it moved through the air, it left a thick
cloud of dust in its wake. To avoid dying everything
yellow, Philip wrapped it in the map of the spider
web.
<!--l. 1280--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 1282--><p class="noindent" >   Mary slid down first through the abandoned tunnel.
When her shrieks died away in the darkness, Raisy
followed. Her voice faded too, then fairy laughter
chimed in the dark passage. This was the signal Philip
was waiting for, and one after another he launched the
barrels of brandy down the slide. Sounds of rolling and
fairy laughter announced the arrival of each one, until
the barrels ran out. Philip descended too, then said
goodbye to Mary and Raisy. The two of them went
sliding again, down into the other section of the
woodworm&#8217;s tunnel, and Philip sent the barrels after
them. The plan was to meet up in Dewington. With his
eighty-eight barrels and Mary&#8217;s nozzle they would be
ready to start the construction of the rocket.
<!--l. 1293--><p class="indent" >   Philip unwrapped his looking stone and scanned
the leaves below him carefully. He was searching
for the grazing land of the ants, but another leaf
caught his eye. The looking stone brought him back to
the streets of Dewington. The wind had ruffled the
roofs of their homes, and there was no trace of its
namesake, the dewdrop in the main square. But all the
buildings were standing, and after Philip traced his
way back to where he started in the morning, he
arrived at his home. He could not see through the
roof, but he hoped his parents were at home and not
worrying about him. He did not want to make them
wait unnecessarily, so he resumed searching for the
flock.
<!--l. 1303--><p class="indent" >   Fairies lived on the surrounding leaves too, and he
saw an ant making the rounds on one of them. He found
two more on the branch, all of them on patrol. He follow
them to another branch. Scanning this one he found a
bud covered in suspicious spots. It was in shadow, so
Philip could not see it well, but he suspected the lost
flock could be found there.
<!--l. 1309--><p class="indent" >   Philip began his brisk descent thinking about how he
would convince the ants to return the fairies&#8217; aphids.
Judy was right, they would never listen to reason. But if
he could lasso the ants, he might be able to tether them
like the fairies tethered the young aphid. Or he could
imitate the sound of the rocket to startle the herd, and
when they flee from the bud to a leaf, he would chop it
right off with the royal sword. Timed right, a gust might
lift them into the air. He could loop spider silk around a
branch to swing the floating leaf around the tree
and into the spider&#8217;s web. From here, the aphids
would all tumble straight down and into the pen
below.
<!--l. 1319--><p class="indent" >   The plan was missing some details. For example, the
royal sword was hanging on the wall of George&#8217;s
living room. But overall it was fairly solid. Philip was
striding confidently toward the bud already. From
this distance he could see that the bud was covered
with aphids and guarded by ants. An ant coming
from the direction of the bud walked over Philip
unexpectedly. He was ready to fight, but the ant trotted
past on its huge legs without notice. Philip&#8217;s knees
shook as the large mass moved by, but he did not turn
back.
<!--l. 1327--><p class="indent" >   What if ants really could not see him? Perhaps he
could lead away the biggest aphid. All the rest would
follow, and the ants would just stare blankly.
<!--l. 1330--><p class="indent" >   That was not what happened once he arrived. No
matter how much he pushed or pulled, the leader
of the herd did not move a bit. Philip tried to lift
the foot of the monstrous aphid, but it did as much
good as wrestling with an ant. He climbed on its
back and slapped the rear instead. The aphid did not
notice this either. He sat on its head and waved in
front of the eyes. He poked its nose with his feet and
shouted in its ear, but the aphid only cared about
the sap. How did he manage to communicate with
Tony? Perhaps this behemoth would also enjoy a fairy
song.
<!--l. 1339--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 1341--><p class="noindent" >   While Philip was struggling with the biggest aphid of
the tree, Mary and Raisy had arrived in Dewington. Both
of them balanced four barrels on their heads and rolled
two more ahead of them with their feet. It was no
wonder that their arrival on the leaf drew much
attention.
<!--l. 1346--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What is it with all the barrels?&#8221; an alga farmer
thought at the edge of the village and took a break from
roof repairs to watch their arrival.
<!--l. 1349--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Look, a blue lady!&#8221; a fairy boy pointed out to his
siblings as he came to a halt. It was a mistake to stop, for
his brother and sister stumbled over him from behind,
and they ended up wrestling in a heap.
<!--l. 1353--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Do I smell brandy?&#8221; a shoemaker said as he opened
his window. The blast from the rocket had mixed up his
shoes, and a good number of them had still not found
their match.
<!--l. 1357--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;How did they climb the stalk with so many barrels?&#8221;
a young fairy pondered in the main square. Nevertheless,
he politely helped them unload, and by the time they
finished they were surrounded by alga farmers, fairy
children, and also shoemakers.
<!--l. 1362--><p class="indent" >   Mary told them of the plan for building a rocket, and
those with nothing more important to do offered their
help. Raisy organized a team to collect damaged roofs
and other debris to build the rocket hull from. Mary
hurried to Philip&#8217;s parents to reassure them.
<!--l. 1367--><p class="indent" >   Philip&#8217;s father and mother were very grateful for the
news of their son and offered her fructose crystals. She
could still smell the berry from which the crystal was
extracted. It tasted very good after the heavy lifting. She
accepted one more for the road, but in return she
had to promise to return their wayward son before
dark.
<!--l. 1373--><p class="indent" >   She ran through the main street with renewed energy
and rushed past Raisy&#8217;s team, who were just trying to
prevent the collapse of their construction with a plant
fiber. When they failed, the rumble made Mary stop for a
moment.
<!--l. 1377--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Go on, Mary,&#8221; Raisy said. &#8220;By the time you get back,
we will be ready. This is only a sketch; the final structure
will be much stronger.&#8221;
<!--l. 1380--><p class="indent" >   Mary wanted to lift their spirits and gave them the
delicious fruit sugar. She listened to their discussion of
the rocket hull structure for a while, then set out on the
way to the ground.
<!--l. 1384--><p class="indent" >   There were few stories about the ground. Her
grandma had told her it was because the fairies had
moved into the trees long ago. What did they do before
that? From her great-grandmother she heard they lived
in a beautiful city. Its towers were as big as trees. And
they had giant machinery that did everything for them.
The machines were the shape of a fairy, but their arms
were thick as tree branches. The machines served them
for a long time, and the fairies grew lazy and forgot
how to work. They even forgot how to repair the
machines when they broke. One day the eyes of the
machines broke and they could no longer see the
tiny fairies. They were no longer able to feed them,
they could not build houses for them, and could not
protect them from insects. The ants were waiting for
this and took over the magnificent city. The fairies
fled every which way. Mary&#8217;s ancestors had fled into
the forest. They did not know where to find food
or what should and should not be eaten. The first
year brought nothing but hardship, but they did
not give up and learned once again to live on their
own.
<!--l. 1399--><p class="indent" >   The trunk grew thicker and the crevices of the bark
deeper as Mary descended. Grains of sand got in
her way. Some of them were as tall as a grown up
fairy. Mary examined the base of each grain. Mud
splashed on by the rain glued the grains of sand to the
bark, and Mary wanted mud. Crouching under a
block she took out her quartz blade and scraped off a
handful of clay from underneath. Shifting the tiny
flakes in her hand, she tried to pick out the cleanest
ones. She touched them to her tongue for taste, and
discarded one of them with a grimace. The other
two she dropped in her pocket and resumed her
trip.
<!--l. 1408--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 1410--><p class="noindent" >   Meanwhile, the lead aphid had made just three steps.
One step forward, one to the right, and one step back.
Philip could not make it move by either strength or song.
He tried locking eyes with it through the looking stone.
Perhaps it would listen to an enlarged fairy. But it did not
work. He was digging around the bottom of his backpack
now, hoping to find something that could affect his
steed.
<!--l. 1417--><p class="indent" >   Half a dozen brightly colored quartz crystals. They
did not write on the fine chitin, the aphid did not want to
eat them, and Philip juggled them in vain. The aphid did
not even move an antenna.
<!--l. 1421--><p class="indent" >   A large jumble of spider silk. It took Philip a lot of
effort to tie this around the legs and body of the aphid,
but then he realized how flexible spider silk was. It did
not hinder the beast at all. It made for an excellent
swing, however.
<!--l. 1426--><p class="indent" >   Two wrinkled fruit fly wings. He unfolded these and
attached them to the aphid&#8217;s head with spider silk, as if
they were droopy ears. Had the aphid moved its head, its
fake ears would have flapped adorably.
<!--l. 1430--><p class="indent" >   A tassel woven from plant fibers. The fibers were
dyed to different colors, and Philip&#8217;s mother showed him
how to weave them. He also showed it to the plant lice,
and wove three of its bristles into a tassel, but to no
avail.
<!--l. 1434--><p class="indent" >   There was the backpack itself, woven from fine plant
membranes. For lack of a better idea, Philip stuck his
head in it and ran around clapping and shouting on the
back of the aphid until he fell down. Fortunately, he
got stuck in the spider silk stretching between the
legs.
<!--l. 1439--><p class="indent" >   Finally, wrapped in the map, there was the golden
yellow shard. Philip did not know exactly what it was,
but he was afraid of it. He honestly expected that the old
ant would help him. But all he got from it was this dusty
fragment. He had heard from adults that everything had
a soul. Perhaps the souls of ants were yellow. The soul of
the old ant might have grown too large and broken out
of its body.
<!--l. 1446--><p class="indent" >   Sitting on the back of the aphid, he carefully
unwrapped the shard and shifted it from one hand to the
other. Its touch dyed his palms a bright yellow.
<!--l. 1449--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Philip, wrap it back up,&#8221; an ant said behind his back.
Philip recognized the voice of Tony, who had carried him
from Dewington to the border of the ant empire.
But it was also possible that all ants had the same
voice.
<!--l. 1453--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;The aphid flock of the fairies ran away,&#8221; Philip
explained, &#8220;and I have come to herd them back. I hope
you do not mind.&#8221;
<!--l. 1456--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I carried the sick ant up high, beyond the border of
the ant empire,&#8221; the ant said. &#8220;Everything that the golden
fungus has touched has to go. You cannot stay here. You
are bad. Your hands are so yellow. Do not touch
anything!&#8221;
<!--l. 1460--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What if I touched something?&#8221; Philip retorted.
<!--l. 1462--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Everything will be bad! Do not touch anything!&#8221;
<!--l. 1464--><p class="indent" >   The ant tried to catch Philip, but it was clearly wary
of the yellow shard. It went around the lice and tried
from the other side, but recoiled when Philip turned to
face it.
<!--l. 1468--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;This aphid is yours, just wrap up the fungus.&#8221;
<!--l. 1470--><p class="indent" >   Philip wrapped up the piece of soul fungus and
climbed down from the aphid, leaving a line of yellow
palm-prints behind. The ants all kept a fair distance
away. Everywhere he went they backed away from
him. Once he was far enough from the lead aphid,
the ants quickly picked it up and carried it off the
bud.
<!--l. 1475--><p class="indent" >   Philip held his golden fingers in front, clawing at the
ants to scare them. He enjoyed not being ignored at last.
On the contrary, they were all watching him now. He
started running between the ants and managed to scare
one of them so much that it fell off the branch. He drew
a yellow stripe on the green surface and laughed at the
ants who did not dare to cross it.
<!--l. 1481--><p class="indent" >   The lice were not scared though, no matter how
much he tried. They did not care even if he left yellow
stamps on them. Of course, the ants were afraid of these
marked lice and carried them away with great care.
Philip felt bad about scaring the ants but could not stop
playing this game. He was running around and stamping
the aphids until the whole herd had been marked with
yellow spots, and the ants obediently carried them all
off.
<!--l. 1488--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; he said to Tony. But the ants had backed
away from the bud, and Philip was left alone.
<!--l. 1491--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 1493--><p class="noindent" >   Mary reached the base of the tree. The trunk was
at its widest here and the roots burrowed into the
ground. She managed to find some fine clay on the way
down, but she needed at least thrice as much. Before
descending to the surface she looked around from atop a
thick root. It was a scary thought to leave the tree.
Detritus covered everything around her. Dry, dead leaves.
Fungi gnawing on their surfaces. The leaves at the
bottom were in the worst shape. They might have fallen
off last year. If someone dared to approach them, they
might have found ruins of fairy cities from the old
year.
<!--l. 1502--><p class="indent" >   Mary heard a noise. A sand lizard ran through the
detritus, pushing whole leaves to the side along the way.
A large animal like that could break Dewington right off
the branch. The lizard ran toward the setting sun. She
saw the dark silhouette of an even larger animal
against the sun. It was a deer tearing off a twig from
the next tree. As she watched it chewing patiently,
Mary could only hope that no fairies lived on those
leaves.
<!--l. 1509--><p class="indent" >   She gathered her courage and descended further on
the root. The bark was breaking up, and she walked in its
long grooves. The grooves were deep as canyons.
Remains of the old bark watched over them. The
highest parts of the bark were from the first years of
the tree. Worn and dried by countless winters and
summers. They had long lost their defenses against
fungi, and a lacework of colorful lichens cast shadows on
Mary.
<!--l. 1516--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Little miss fairy! Fairy girl! Where to, where to?&#8221; a
voice called down from the lichen. Had he not called,
Mary would not have noticed the fat gray mite. His obese
body rested on a couch woven from the mycelium. His
eight feet dangled around the edges of the recess. One of
them lazily dug into the dense weave of fungal filaments
and pulled out a lump of green alga from the bottom
layer.
<!--l. 1523--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I will answer you if you can answer a riddle for me,&#8221;
said Mary. The mites were famous for never worrying
about anything. They were not much bigger than
a fairy but were as strong as an ant. So they had
no one to fear and could take anything they liked.
They lived their comfortable lives peacefully and
were always up for a game. &#8220;What are clouds made
of?&#8221;
<!--l. 1529--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Oh, little fairy, to ask that of a mite,&#8221; the mite
above laughed and swallowed the lump of alga. &#8220;My
cousin was a famous traveler. The wind took him
everywhere, even above the clouds,&#8221; he continued with
his mouth full. &#8220;The cloud is nothing more than a
lot of water droplets that the wind holds in the air.
They may be about the size of your head, little girl.
If they grow big enough to fit you, the wind can
hold them no longer and they fall down. That is the
rain!&#8221;
<!--l. 1537--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I will be a traveler too when I grow up,&#8221; said Mary,
&#8220;and I will go up above the clouds. I will see then
whether you were right or not. I will come back if you
were wrong!&#8221;
<!--l. 1541--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I will wait here, sweetie. But now tell me, where are
you going? The fairies live on the leaves above. Have you
perhaps dropped something?&#8221;
<!--l. 1544--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I am searching for clay. We will build a rocket nozzle
from it.&#8221;
<!--l. 1546--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;You want to search among the roots?&#8221; the mite
asked in surprise. &#8220;Did you remember to bring your
lantern? It is pitch dark down there, little fairy. You know
what? If you can answer my riddle, I will give you a
lantern. I found it between the gills of a milk-cap. A
firefly must have lost it. It can be yours if you answer
right. What does it mean when a firefly is blinking in
yellow?&#8221;
<!--l. 1552--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;It is signaling a turn,&#8221; Mary said right away. She got
the lantern from the mite too. It was a hairball that
smelled like a mushroom and glowed faintly in the
twilight.
<!--l. 1556--><p class="indent" >   Mary thanked the mite for the useful gift and
continued on her way. The root curved to the right,
curved to the left, then curved down. Mary cautiously
followed it down under the big black lumps of earth. She
saw nothing until her eyes became accustomed to the
darkness. The air was musty with the smell of mold and
bacteria working in the soil. Much moisture was trapped
in the rich structure of the ground, and Mary was
wary of falling into a muddy pool. It would be the
end of her pretty dress and of the clay collected so
far.
<!--l. 1564--><p class="indent" >   As the root passed under the ground, fine hairs
stemmed from it. They ran out into the mysterious world
of the soil and absorbed all the moisture and nutrients
that the tree needed. Mary descended further. The
topsoil had a lot of decaying plant matter and tiny
creatures were having a feast all over it. It would have
been difficult and gross to push them aside to reach the
mineral clots.
<!--l. 1571--><p class="indent" >   Deeper still a long discarded pod of chitin blocked
Mary&#8217;s way. An insect larva wore it years ago, chewing
on the root, until it grew large and cast off its skin. The
root had grown thicker since then and pressed into the
abandoned husk. Mary put her lantern, the glowing knot
of hair, on her head as a hat and pulled out her sharp
quartz knife. She pierced the barrier and cut a round
hole into it with a quick motion. As she was rolling up
the patch of skin, she saw a red light deep below. She
fumbled in surprise and got tangled in the thin chitin.
She struggled to break free and by the time she cast off
the larva skin she was tumbling down into the hole she
had cut.
<!--l. 1581--><p class="indent" >   To stop her fall, Mary stabbed the knife into the root
surface rushing by. She slowed, then stopped and
finally stood on a root hair. A clear drop of water
seeped out from the scratch the blade had etched
and fell on her head. She shivered. Where did the
red light come from? It was nowhere to be seen
now.
<!--l. 1586--><p class="indent" >   Mary balanced herself on the narrow root hair. The
white path wound among large, cool nuggets. A
patchwork of black hyphae covered their sides and
filaments stretched in the space between them too. She
held her sharp knife ahead and opened a path into the
darkness.
<!--l. 1591--><p class="indent" >   She had just gotten used to shredding the black
strands like a windmill when they ran out. Her arm
swung at the empty air for a moment, then she stopped
and looked around. The strands stayed on the right
because they found nothing to digest on the left. The
nugget to the left shimmered bare and gray. Clay! The
quartz knife went to work again and Mary&#8217;s pockets
started filling out.
<!--l. 1597--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 1599--><p class="noindent" >   Meanwhile, Philip arrived to the ranch under
Solperla. There was a great deal of excitement there.
They had found a big aphid, to the head of which
someone had tied a pair of wings. And as they drove it
toward the farm they saw another one. When they threw
a lasso on that aphid, an ant had just carried up one
more. The ant put it down at the border of their empire
and refused to let it climb back. It stood in the aphid&#8217;s
way, until the fairies led it off to their ranch. This went
on all night. The flock the ants returned was twice as
large as the flock the fairies had lost. And on the side
of each aphid the yellow prints of five tiny fingers
gleamed.
<!--l. 1609--><p class="indent" >   Once they saw Philip&#8217;s yellow hands and heard his
story, all the fairies, big and small, celebrated him. They
set a long table right away, and everyone brought
something delicious from their pantries. With such a
large flock they no longer feared the winter. They served
soured insect egg soup and fried alga rolls for starters.
The next dish was balls of cheese wrapped in thin
slices of smoked aphid ham. And while the fairies
feasted, the dessert was prepared as well. They cut a
large pollen in half and filled it with fruit pulp. One
half was prepared for the children with fresh pulp;
the other half for the adults with partly fermented
pulp.
<!--l. 1619--><p class="indent" >   The feast lasted all night, but Philip still had
important things to do. He asked Judy for help, and
together they milked all the lice. They gave more than
enough honeydew to fill up all barrels.
<!--l. 1623--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What a big flock you have brought us, Philip,&#8221; Judy
mused. &#8220;We need to build more barrels. We will need a
larger pen too. It will be a lot of work. We cannot let our
young ones go to Solperla to try their luck now. The leaf
may turn out to be too small too. We will have to find
two leaves in the spring. If they lay many eggs, perhaps
even three.&#8221;
<!--l. 1629--><p class="indent" >   When the barrels ran out, they collected the
honeydew into baskets, tablecloths, and bedsheets.
Overall they got more of it than there was water
in the dewdrop of Dewington. The only remaining
question was how they would ferment and distill all of
it.
<!--l. 1634--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;It is good sweet honey the new lice gave,&#8221; said a
fairy with a mustache, &#8220;and the evenings are still
warm. If we add the yeast now, it will get fizzy by the
morning.&#8221;
<!--l. 1638--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;But how will we distill it?&#8221; asked another fairy, who
could have been his twin brother. &#8220;You cannot kibble that
much dew mead by hand.&#8221;
<!--l. 1641--><p class="indent" >   They argued on, and Philip learned of more tricks
of the distillation process than he ever could have
imagined. For instance, after fermentation the dew
mead was usually kibbled into small beads so that it
would evaporate quickly. They were trying to figure
out something more efficient, but everyone agreed
on one thing. If they wanted to let the honeydew
ferment by the morning, they had to add the yeast now.
All the fairies who were on a short break from the
celebrations helped with this. And Philip headed
home.
<!--l. 1649--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 1651--><p class="noindent" >   The clay weighed so heavily on Mary&#8217;s pockets that it
was pulling her skirt down. The clever solution she
found was to fashion suspenders from a few black
fungal filaments to hold it up. The nugget of clay she
had been mining was covered in scratches from her
quartz knife. Her hard work had stripped off the
surface to the depth of three fingers at least. The
clay was entirely pure. Neither grains of sand nor
plant-matter-digesting hyphae were to be found
in it. This was exactly what Mary needed for the
nozzle, and she was very glad to have found the
nugget.
<!--l. 1660--><p class="indent" >   One pocket was full and the other was getting there
too when, to Mary&#8217;s surprise, red light traced her knife&#8217;s
path. The dim radiance had to have come from inside the
nugget. To find its source, she twisted the knife to
enlarge the hole. No matter how much she peeked she
only saw clay illuminated in red. She continued to work
until she had enlarged the hole to the size of her
hand.
<!--l. 1666--><p class="indent" >   Sticking her face to the opening she could now see
that the nugget was hollow. She had cut a funnel-shaped
hole into a span of clay wall. On Mary&#8217;s side the hole was
as big as her hand, but on the other end it was as if she
had poked a hole with a finger &#x2026;&#x00A0;As if she had poked a
hole with a finger through the living room wallpaper of a
fairy. She saw the back of a couch. The couch faced a
fireplace. Compressed blocks of cellulose smoldered
inside and radiated a warm glow upon the room. Neatly
framed pictures lined the mantelpiece. Mounted
on the wall above them the scary head of a worm
stretched its mustache toward Mary. A red-striped
wallpaper covered the walls. They bulged outward a
bit, but the room still had corners. In one corner a
well-shaped fungus grew in a clay pot. The yellow
mushroom was practically glowing against the red
wallpaper.
<!--l. 1678--><p class="indent" >   A fairy stood up from the couch and turned to face
Mary. His outline was gleaming from the light of the
embers. He was tall and burly. The wide shoulders
carried a bald head, but on both sides a thick mustache
broke its dark circle. It was just like the mustache of the
trophy above the fireplace. A black cloth covered his
right eye. The left one watched the hole closely. As
Mary recoiled, the stern face flashed green from the
light of her glowing hat. The fairy girl screamed and
ran.
<!--l. 1686--><p class="indent" >   She did not run far before the hyphae she had cut
earlier slapped into her face. She lost her balance and
almost fell off the narrow root hair. She clung to the web
of filaments and hurried on, grabbing them every few
steps for balance. Her heart beat so loudly she could not
hear anything else. But she imagined that the fairy with
the big mustache had knocked down the wall and
was furiously galloping behind her. She dared not
look back, not into the single eye flashing in green.
She stumbled toward the root, away from the soil,
back to the leaves, back to the well known world of
Dewington.
<!--l. 1695--><p class="indent" >   She thought she had lost her way in the black jungle
of hyphae, when she finally saw the pale column of the
root. But just as she started to run toward it, a terrible
shadow formed ahead of her. The one-eyed fairy was
riding a long slithering mass as thick as her waist. In his
eye the cold reflection of her green lantern danced. The
blood froze in Mary&#8217;s veins; she was paralyzed by fear.
The monster pulled a red light from under his jacket and
held it up high.
<!--l. 1702--><p class="indent" >   He looked just as evil in the red light as Mary had
imagined. Or at least almost as evil. A little less evil,
because the mouth under the thick mustache formed a
wide smile.
<!--l. 1706--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Steady, Anaconda,&#8221; he soothed his steed. &#8220;You are
scaring our guest.&#8221;
<!--l. 1708--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 1710--><p class="noindent" >   The sun was setting. In the long shadows that were
filling the grooves of the bark Philip saw serpentine
shapes.
<!--l. 1713--><p class="indent" >   A short while earlier he knew no fear and swung
from one thread of the spider web to the other, whistling
a song. But in the sanctuary, among the intricate
carvings, he fell silent. As he had hoped, he received help
from the peculiar ant. But he did not quite understand
what happened. The ants said he did something bad, but
the fairies said he did good. He did not know what his
parents would have to say about it. As he turned the
thoughts in his mind, he felt relieved at times and
guilt-ridden at others. But, as the shadows grew longer,
the pride waned and the guilt waxed. Did the ants have a
full pantry? Would they have something to eat in the
spring?
<!--l. 1723--><p class="indent" >   The world of the bark was busy at dusk. The stalking
forms of the night had risen but the alert beings of the
day had not retired yet either. Everyone was hunting or
being hunted at this hour. Protozoa were running from
waterbears. Mites were wrestling nematodes. Hyphae
snatched the fallen. And the ever-changing shadows of
conscience chased Philip.
<!--l. 1729--><p class="indent" >   He ran from the long shadows and wet sounds as fast
as his legs would carry him. He wanted to be back in
Dewington. He was tired, but if he slowed down
the sounds came closer. Sticky hyphae caught his
foot in a ditch. While he pulled it free, the shadows
caught up. And they passed him. An army of diversely
shaped protozoa and other small creatures slipped
and crawled by him. They ignored the fairy as if
they were hurrying to Dewington as well, so they
would be home by dinner too. Philip freed his leg and
looked after the hairy, sticky, tentacled crowd in
bewilderment.
<!--l. 1738--><p class="indent" >   Unexpectedly, a shadow fell upon him from behind.
So that was why the protozoa fled! A big yellow wall
rose above the cliffs of the bark and raced toward Philip.
It slowed down, stopped, and then took off again. Philip
stopped staring at it and broke into a sprint. The slime
mold must have crawled into a dark, dank corner during
the day, and once shadows covered the bark its time had
come. The huge, throbbing cell pushed itself forward
with each pulse and digested everything in its path.
That was why the tiny inhabitants of the bark were
running. A dozen fairies could not have stopped
it.
<!--l. 1747--><p class="indent" >   Philip tried to keep to the last sunny spots and
hop across shadows. But when approaching a big
outcropping of bark he had no choice but to step into the
dark. It was dangerous to run blindly on the uneven
ground, but he could not slow down. The slime mold
picked up speed in the cool shade and was on Philip&#8217;s
heels with each pulse. Philip ran close to the cliff,
which offered some shelter from the slime mold.
But when the cliff ended he had to run through an
open field. He had almost reached the end of the
shadow when his foot got caught in another ditch
and he stumbled. He tried to jump back on his feet,
but his shoe had become stuck. This was the slime
mold&#8217;s chance, and its yellow wall rushed toward
Philip.
<!--l. 1758--><p class="indent" >   Suddenly, a big ball of fur popped out of nowhere
and jumped against the wall. The ball bounced back like
rubber, but the impact also stopped the wall for a
moment. A ring of waves spread on the surface of the
slime mold. The waves did not get far before the ball of
fur slammed into the wall again.
<!--l. 1763--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Run, Babouche!&#8221; shouted Philip when he managed
to untangle his foot. Paramecium and fairy ran side by
side from the yellow wall. Fortunately, the bark became
smoother and the shadows fewer as they approached
Dewington. The light of the setting sun forced the slime
mold to stop there, and the two friends merrily chased
each other until they got home.
<!--l. 1769--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 1771--><p class="noindent" >   The dewdrop had long ago evaporated from the main
square. The morning&#8217;s crowd of fairies had evaporated
too. There were no vendors, and no one came to
fill their canteens. At dusk the streets emptied, the
doors and windows shut. Philip saw just one old fairy
sitting on his porch, but he did not return the boy&#8217;s
greeting. He must have fallen asleep and would only
wake up when the early chills of the autumn pinched
him.
<!--l. 1778--><p class="indent" >   Yet the square was not empty. A big pile of cellulose
and chitin littered it. Plant fiber and spider silk wove
through the heap. Twelve barrels of brandy lay strewn
about. And from one of the barrels a monstrous snoring
was heard. The barrel rocked back and forth lazily to the
rhythm of the snore.
<!--l. 1783--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Philip timidly.
<!--l. 1785--><p class="indent" >   There was a pause in snoring, then the barrel
resumed rocking. With Babouche by his side he moved
closer and peeked into the barrel.
<!--l. 1788--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Raisy!&#8221; he exclaimed.
<!--l. 1790--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Leave me alone,&#8221; snorted the barrel. Babouche was
excited to hear the familiar voice and jumped in by Raisy.
It must not have been comfortable for either of them
because a lot of tossing and turning followed. In the end
the barrel started to roll and hit the pile of building
materials. Raisy tumbled out of it with Babouche on
her head and lay spread out on the surface of the
leaf.
<!--l. 1797--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Captain Philip,&#8221; she perked up a moment later, &#8220;we
have evaluated two dozen different rocket hull designs,
sir. And,&#8221; she added almost inaudibly, &#8220;emptied a dozen
barrels of brandy in the process.&#8221;
<!--l. 1801--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;This is great news, navigator Raisy,&#8221; responded
Philip. &#8220;Have you found the perfect design then?&#8221;
<!--l. 1804--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;We have &#x2026;&#x00A0;some more ideas. And tell me Philip, how
did it go with the ants? Did you get them to return the
flock?&#8221;
<!--l. 1807--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Yes. And they returned more than had been lost,&#8221; he
boasted.
<!--l. 1809--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;That is great news, Captain!&#8221; she said. Then her eyes
widened. &#8220;What? Did they really return the lice? What
did you do, Philip?&#8221;
<!--l. 1812--><p class="indent" >   Philip told her what had happened on the pasture of
the ants. To share the story they climbed on top of the
collapsed buildings and enjoyed the fresh air. Babouche
curled up on their feet and, faithful to his name, kept the
tiny toes of the fairies warm. Raisy listened carefully to
how much the ants had feared the golden powder and
how they carried the flock up to the fairies. When Philip
went on to describe the feast, she got rather hungry. But
only a small clump of dried alga remained in her
satchel.
<!--l. 1820--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;A slime mold so high in the tree?&#8221; she gasped when
he reached the end of the story. &#8220;You were lucky that
Babouche found you. I also met a slime mold when I was
about your age, Philip. My brother Gil was even younger
and a restless little rascal. Together we ambushed a flea
and rode it around the tree. There was not much to hold
on to on its smooth back, and Gil clowned about
until it threw us off with a jump. We landed in a
shady cleft in the bark and laughed so much we
could not see from the tears. Suddenly Gil stopped
laughing. When I noticed that I was laughing alone I
opened my eyes. The remains of a mite lay beside us.
Something had completely stripped the exoskeleton.
Under our feet the decayed cell membranes of protozoa
covered the bark. We did not know how these tiny
creatures might have perished, but we were very
scared. We tried to tiptoe out of the crevice, when
suddenly&#8212;&#8221;
<!--l. 1833--><p class="indent" >   The stars had disappeared from the sky during her
story, and the darkness deepened. When she came to
the scariest part, lightning flashed. The lightning
illuminated a terrible serpentine form in the main square
of Dewington.
<!--l. 1837--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Ah!&#8221; screamed Raisy and Philip. They staggered from
the sight of the monster and tumbled from the top of the
experimental rocket hull. The thunder and shouting
woke up the old fairy sleeping on his porch too, and
he stared into the darkness. By the next lightning
he too could see the half-snake, half-fairy form. He
stumbled over his bench, fled into the house, and
slammed the door. And then shuttered the window
too.
<!--l. 1844--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;This is scarier than the slime mold,&#8221; said Raisy from
one of the barrels. Philip snuck back to the top of the pile
and stuck his head out to peek at the terrible squirming
form. The clouds had covered the moon and the
stars. Everything was black. But Philip had a good
eye, and different things were different shades of
black.
<!--l. 1850--><p class="indent" >   The winding form had to have been that of a large
nematode. Three dark figures were riding on its back.
One was a big, brawny fairy; another was a small, fragile
fairy. But the largest figure sat between the two.
Shapeless arms, tentacles, and claws protruded from it in
every direction. It really was scarier than the slime mold,
but Philip boldly crept closer. He heard a whisper from
the black riders.
<!--l. 1857--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Did you see Raisy tumble down?&#8221; asked one.
<!--l. 1859--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I did! And did you see Philip&#8217;s face in the lightning&#8217;s
flash?&#8221; asked the other with a suppressed chuckle in her
voice.
<!--l. 1862--><p class="indent" >   Philip recognized Mary&#8217;s voice right away, but he did
not want to miss a good chance for a scare. In the dark
anyone could surprise anyone. Mary and her two
mysterious companions on the back of the worm
slithered toward the center of the square while Philip
took a small detour to get behind their backs. He put
his empty backpack on his head and grabbed the
unsuspecting Mary.
<!--l. 1868--><p class="indent" >   A great deal of screaming, wrestling, and chasing was
the result. By the time they were both so exhausted
that they could no longer be scared, Raisy had also
emerged from her barrel, and Mary introduced her
companions.
<!--l. 1872--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;This is Anaconda,&#8221; she pointed at the ever-winding
worm. &#8220;And this is John.&#8221;
<!--l. 1875--><p class="indent" >   The bald fairy climbed off his steed and pulled out
a glowing red lantern. His left eye glowed in the
light but the right eye was covered with black felt.
Under a big nose his long mustache covered a friendly
smile.
<!--l. 1879--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I am not the famous hero,&#8221; he said, &#8220;just his
namesake. I apologize for scaring you. It was Mary&#8217;s
idea.&#8221;
<!--l. 1882--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I had to scare someone after being scared myself,&#8221;
Mary said. &#8220;John lives underground and is a fearsome
hunter. When we met I was so afraid of him I wanted to
run away. He just wanted to talk, however. So many
exciting things had happened to him under the ground,
but he is the only fairy there, and there is no one to listen
to his stories.&#8221;
<!--l. 1888--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;And your other companion?&#8221; Raisy said.
<!--l. 1890--><p class="indent" >   Mary pulled out her green fur lantern and shone its
light on the third rider. The misshapen figure was
neither a fairy nor any other creature. A big pile of
clay was molded into all sorts of appendages. They
had used strips of bast fiber to tie it to Anaconda&#8217;s
back. In the green light all its terrifying features had
disappeared. It even had a big smile sculpted on its
face.
<!--l. 1896--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;This is Jimbo,&#8221; beamed Mary. &#8220;Until recently, he was
the wall of John&#8217;s living room. But today he has decided
to become a nozzle!&#8221;
<!--l. 1899--><p class="indent" >   Neither Philip nor Raisy understood much of that.
Mary had to tell them everything on their way home.
Mary&#8217;s parents invited John inside, and Philip&#8217;s parents
sat Raisy down to their dinner table. Conversation
filled the two small houses on the tip of the leaf.
The children told of their adventures, and the polite
travelers compared the dark world of the soil and
the distant world of the pine tree with the green
leaf of Dewington. Slowly the light of the lanterns
faded, and everyone grew curious of the next day.
They said goodbye to each other and all went to
bed.
<!--l. 1908--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 1910--><p class="noindent" >   Philip turned in his bed twice, then had a better idea.
He picked up the looking stone from his nightstand and
snuck out to the back of the house. Mary was sitting
on the edge of the leaf already, her feet dangling
above the abyss. He lent her the looking stone and
gazed thoughtfully at the black leaves sprawling
below.
<!--l. 1916--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Mary, where would you like to fly the most?&#8221;
<!--l. 1918--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;To Raisy&#8217;s pine! She promised to teach me how to
bake a resin cake.&#8221;
<!--l. 1920--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What about after that? If the rocket works, we can
fly it anywhere.&#8221;
<!--l. 1922--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Mary. She started to think
on it now. &#8220;There is the raspberry bush by the big rock.
The wind always blows delicious smells from there,
right? Do you think it could take us there?&#8221;
<!--l. 1926--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Of course it could! We would have to be careful with
the landing. We would not want to get caught on the
sharp thorns. But the leaves are safe. And where would
you fly from there?&#8221;
<!--l. 1930--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Back to Dewington. We could bring back a whole
berry, and everyone could have some of it.&#8221;
<!--l. 1933--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;All right. But after that we will fly up to the tip of
the old tree that stands on the hill top. From there
we would see trees that we cannot see from here.
And we would go on until we reach the edge of the
forest.&#8221;
<!--l. 1937--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;And maybe we would find another forest there. One
which is full of raspberry bushes. And blackberry
bushes.&#8221;
<!--l. 1940--><p class="indent" >   That is how the two little fairies planned their trip
until they grew sleepy.
<!--l. 1942--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 1944--><p class="noindent" >   Philip dreamed that he was little. As small as one of
his eyelashes. He was in his room, adventuring within
the forest of the soft fibers in his carpet. Suddenly it
became dark, and as he looked up he saw that Mary was
sitting on the bed. They were in Mary&#8217;s room and not
Philip&#8217;s.
<!--l. 1949--><p class="indent" >   Philip climbed to the top of the carpet and leapt from
one fiber to the next. From red to yellow, from yellow to
white, from white to blue. Then he realized that if he
jumped on the colored threads in the right order, his
shoes would become brighter. Mary held the looking
stone in reverse, so she could examine the minuscule,
radiant shoes. The only light was now coming from the
shoes, and the tiny Philip cast a giant&#8217;s shadow on the
wall of the room. The shadow was so big that it could lift
Mary in its hand.
<!--l. 1957--><p class="indent" >   Philip, the shadow giant, rode on the back of a giant
ant. He wore a golden yellow robe, and his steed had the
same yellow color. But Mary saddled a lizard and met
Philip&#8217;s army of golden ants on the plain below the leaf.
The lizard swept away dozens of ants with its tail, but
then made peace with them. She helped up the little ants
and fed them raspberries from her saddlebags. The ants
in turn helped her build a huge machine shaped like a
fairy. Its foot was bigger than a whole leaf. Its shoes
were built from a dozen large snail shells. Its leg was
a tree trunk. It was so tall that it could reach the
lower branches of the tree while standing on the
ground. On top of its neck it wore Philip&#8217;s smiling
head.
<!--l. 1968--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;But what is this giant machine good for?&#8221; Mary
asked.
<!--l. 1970--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;For playing tag!&#8221; Philip exclaimed and lunged for the
lizard. But the lizard was nimble, and the giant&#8217;s
hands grasped only dry leaves. He held the leaves
to his eyes to see who dwelled on them, but did
not see anything. The lizard ate the leaves. It ran
circles around Philip and cleaned up the forest floor
in his path. As it sucked in all the leaves it grew
bigger and bigger. When it got big enough, Philip sat
on its back behind Mary, and they rode among the
trees.
<!--l. 1977--><p class="indent" >   Soon the lizard became as big as a tree, and Philip
jumped from its back onto the top of their tree. He
balanced on the uppermost leaf of the tree just as a
rocket rose from the valley. Its light shone throughout
the forest, and all the leaves fell off. Philip also began to
fall, but the rocket quickly changed direction and caught
him mid-fall. The rocket was big as the giant lizard, and
covered in complex winches, ropes, and arms. Mary
opened a hatch and let Philip inside. They flew up into
the sky and flew to the sun and the moon. It was autumn
on the sun and all the leaves were yellow. It was
winter on the moon and white snow covered the trees.
Only one tree was green, Raisy&#8217;s pine. The kind lady
waved at them from her round window cut into the
side of one of the needles. They skillfully landed on
her doorstep. Since everything was upside down on
the moon, when they got out Philip began to fall
toward the earth. Mary did not understand why he was
falling toward the earth and drank a cup of tea with
Raisy.
<!--l. 1992--><p class="indent" >   Philip was falling and falling and getting smaller.
When he fell from the moon his foot was as big as
Dewington. But when he reached the branches of their
tree, he was only as big as an ant. By the time he fell on
the roof, he had shrunk to the size of a fairy. He fell right
into his bed and sat up. His mother offered him a cup of
tea for breakfast.
<!--l. 1998--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 2000--><p class="noindent" >   Raisy was sitting on the terrace of a caf in the main
square. A sheet of cellulose paper covered her small,
round table like a tablecloth. The calculations were
already flowing off the edges of the table, but the
pencil was still busy in her hand. One formula led to
another, and her model of the behavior of different
rocket hulls became more accurate. She calculated
the forces which would affect various parts of the
hull during takeoff given different designs. A hull of
greater weight could be stronger but at one point
would start to have difficulty supporting its own
weight. When Raisy was young, she was taught how
the different varieties of cellulose and chitin held
under pressure. During her work as an engineer
she learned about using support beams, columns,
arches, and domes to strengthen a structure. Now she
was making calculations to know how each design
would work in this case. After all the unsuccessful
experiments last night, she preferred to do the analysis
on paper.
<!--l. 2014--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Let me see where this derivative becomes zero,&#8221; she
muttered when Philip joined her at the table. &#8220;I&#x00A0;am
almost done with the calculations, Philip. No need
to worry about the rocket hull. I will be ready by
noon at the latest. I am going to have one more
coffee.&#8221;
<!--l. 2019--><p class="indent" >   Philip did not want to disturb her. It rained overnight,
and the raindrops washed away the half-built rocket and
the empty barrels. Nothing but a huge ball of water sat in
the middle of the main square. It scattered the light of
the rising sun in every direction, but it was especially
generous to a bench on the edge of the square. It cast a
shadow on the houses around the bench, but the light
that it took from the houses it gave to the bench. At
sunrise only the old fairies who woke early basked in the
warmth of the focal point on this bench. But over time
a group of children had joined them. In the end
their old ears started aching from the squeals of the
younglings, and they let the children have the bench to
themselves.
<!--l. 2030--><p class="indent" >   As the sun rose higher, the hot spot slowly moved
closer to the center of the square. It had mostly crept off
of the bench, and the crowd of children was trying to
push the bench back under it. A blonde fairy boy took his
chance for a bit of sunbathing while the others struggled,
causing a tug of war to erupt.
<!--l. 2035--><p class="indent" >   Once they had made peace, Philip helped out with
moving the bench. Soon they could all enjoy the comfort
of condensed sunlight. They had worked up a sweat in
the effort, but the tiny droplets quickly evaporated from
their brows in the heat.
<!--l. 2040--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; Philip exclaimed. &#8220;We can easily distill the
mead here!&#8221;
<!--l. 2042--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;The what?&#8221; asked the blonde boy. But Philip was
already on his way to the shepherd fairies.
<!--l. 2045--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 2047--><p class="noindent" >   At the outskirts of Dewington Philip stumbled into
Mary and John. Mary was sitting on Anaconda&#8217;s back,
and John, with the reins in his hand, was teaching her
how to ride. Philip saw the nematode in daylight for the
first time. Its skin was bright red and smooth like a drop
of water. A girth of sticky hyphae held the saddle on its
muscular body, and John explained how to control
Anaconda by the bridle on its nose.
<!--l. 2054--><p class="indent" >   After Mary was done, Philip too learned how to ride
the gentle worm. Meanwhile, he told Mary and John of
his plan to distill the rocket fuel in the focal point of the
big drop in the main square. Mary in turn explained how
the nozzle would be prepared.
<!--l. 2059--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;We will need two tamed nematodes. One of them
slides around in a small circle while the other one makes
a larger circle around it in the opposite direction. We
place wet clay in between them, and their smooth skins
will shape it into a thin ring. As we add more clay, the
pressure from the worms will squeeze the moisture out
of it, and a solidifying wall of clay will rise between
them. We carefully guide both worms to gradually widen
or narrow the inside and the outside. This way we can
build the nozzle in the exact shape that Raisy has
engineered.&#8221;
<!--l. 2068--><p class="indent" >   John and Philip shared appreciative glances. Mary
had indeed put a lot of careful thought into the method
of nozzle construction. Fairies could use the same
method later for building large tanks and kegs too. With
more worms and enough clay they could even use it for
constructing buildings.
<!--l. 2073--><p class="indent" >   They all took off on Anaconda&#8217;s back to capture
nematodes for the children. Even with the three fairies
on its back, the bright red worm slid on the uneven
surface of the branch like the wind. The fairy kids
enjoyed the rush, but all too soon they reached their
destination.
<!--l. 2078--><p class="indent" >   Moss grew on the northern side of the tree even at
this height. In the tangled forest of moss stems moisture
was trapped, and the dark water was teeming with life.
Tardigrades frolicked, amoebae exercised, and a
mosquito larva filled one of the larger droplets entirely
by itself. And on the wet clods wild nematodes slipped
from shadow to shadow.
<!--l. 2084--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;They move in swarms, you see,&#8221; John pointed at the
worms. The dark, dank world under the moss was his
world. Each animal reminded him of a past adventure.
Philip and Mary listened in awe. &#8220;This yellow-striped
swarm is too wild. Can you see the teeth? It would rather
tear my arm off than let me ride it. The white ones in the
drop over there are easy to handle and very good
swimmers, but they cannot deal with dry land. But up
there, high up in the moss &#x2026;&#x00A0;Do you see the red
flashes?&#8221;
<!--l. 2092--><p class="indent" >   Green light filtered down into the forest of dark
stalks. The moss leaves at the very top bathed in the sun
and covered the blue sky entirely. As Mary and Philip
strained their eyes, they saw something red appear
and then disappear immediately among the moss
leaves.
<!--l. 2097--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Those are relatives of Anaconda. Agile, strong
worms. They love alga. Come on, let us collect some
alga. If we trap a worm and then hand feed it, it will turn
into a tame steed right away.&#8221;
<!--l. 2101--><p class="indent" >   They fished out green, fist-sized balls from a bright
drop of water. Philip tasted one, and it was good and
juicy; just a little tart. John also taught them which
hyphae made a good harness. This fungus was a danger
to the wild worms, because they could easily get stuck in
its adhesive threads. The fairies carefully coiled up a
long hypha and started climbing toward the moss
leaves.
<!--l. 2107--><p class="indent" >   The red worms avoided them at first, but could not
resist when they saw the beautiful green balls of alga.
They circled the fairies and snatched the algae from their
hands with lightning fast movements. John tied the
hypha into a loop and held it in front of the alga in his
other hand. When the worm took the alga he pulled on
the rope, but the worm had avoided the noose or was
just too fast. John loosened the noose and tried again.
The second time he got lucky, and the sticky thread
fastened on the midriff of the worm. John paid out some
rope until the worm ended up orbiting them on a
leash.
<!--l. 2116--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;And now we carefully draw it in,&#8221; John said. &#8220;It
could easily drag off all three of us, but the moss stems
are even stronger. I tie the thread around a stem like
this,&#8221; he demonstrated. &#8220;And note this knot. We can draw
on it, but when the worm pulls from the other direction
it will hold.&#8221;
<!--l. 2121--><p class="indent" >   He used the wily knot to pull the worm gradually
closer. The other members of the swarm recognized the
trap and bolted. Left on its own, the scared worm soon
tired of struggling and gave up. Trembling, it awaited its
fate. Philip held an alga to its snout. The worm sniffed it
uncertainly then accepted it. Philip fed it some more and
scratched its back like John advised him to. The
nematode calmed down and let them turn the loop
around its back into a simple saddle and tie a bridle on
its head.
<!--l. 2129--><p class="indent" >   Philip named his new friend Rocket. Anaconda
gave it a friendly sniff, and after a bit of hesitation
Rocket allowed Philip to lead it on a leash. It was
slightly slimmer than Anaconda, but it still had the
strength of several fairies. Soon it allowed Philip
to sit on its back, and until Rocket got used to the
reins they zigzagged between the moss stems with
abandon.
<!--l. 2135--><p class="indent" >   Once they learned to understand each other, they set
out to catch a worm for Mary. On his nimble steed Philip
helped steer a swarm of red worms toward John and
Mary.
<!--l. 2139--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Good luck,&#8221; he waved to Mary as she baited the
worms with an alga. &#8220;We will meet in Dewington. I will
bring down the mead and by the time the nozzle is built
we will have the fuel as well.&#8221;
<!--l. 2143--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Good luck, Philip,&#8221; they waved to Philip from the
ring of red worms as he rode away on Rocket.
<!--l. 2146--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 2148--><p class="noindent" >   Philip&#8217;s knees were a little weak when he dismounted
from Rocket on the shepherds&#8217; leaf. The speed of the
worm was terrifying in the rifts of the bark, but they
arrived safely. The fairies of the leaf admired his shiny
red steed and greeted Philip cheerfully.
<!--l. 2153--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Captain Philip,&#8221; said Alexander, one of the
mustachioed masters of honeydew fermentation. He
picked up the habit of addressing Philip as <span 
class="bchri7t-">captain </span>from
Raisy, but a playful esteem rang in his voice. &#8220;I&#x00A0;took a
look at the barrels just now. They got good and smelly.
The honeydew fermented finely. The only problem is that
we could not knead this much mead in the whole
day.&#8221;
<!--l. 2159--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;And we will not have to,&#8221; Philip said while tethering
Rocket to the stables. &#8220;I&#x00A0;think we can distill it in
Dewington. There is a big drop of dew on the main
square of our leaf which collects the sunlight. If we put a
barrel in its focal point, it will warm up right away, and
the spirit will rise up.&#8221;
<!--l. 2164--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What do you make of that, Alexander?&#8221; asked
Alexander his partner, with whom he shared not only the
task of making brandy but the name as well. &#8220;Could we
distill spirit like that?&#8221;
<!--l. 2168--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;It could work if we kept stirring the juice. If we hit
the right temperature, the spirit will part from the
water.&#8221;
<!--l. 2171--><p class="indent" >   Once they exhausted this topic, the discussion turned
to the question of how one hundred barrels full of mead
could be transported. Half a dozen lice could have
carried them, but running a caravan through the empire
of the ants was a great risk. Philip did not know how
many barrels Rocket would be able to carry, but certainly
much less than an aphid.
<!--l. 2177--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Nice nematode,&#8221; Greg spoke from behind Philip&#8217;s
back. Philip turned in surprise to see his spider friend
hanging upside down on a fine thread of silk. Greg
focused his eight eyes on Rocket.
<!--l. 2181--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Good morning, Greg,&#8221; Philip greeted him. &#8220;I&#x00A0;hope
last night&#8217;s rain did not soak you.&#8221;
<!--l. 2184--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;We took shelter under the branch. The web always
fills up with food before the rain, so we do not regret the
inconvenience. Mom is cooking a delicious lunch right
now. Want to play a game until she is done?&#8221;
<!--l. 2188--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Did you see how the fairies in Solperla swing their
cargo from one end of the leaf to the other on threads of
silk? Let&#8217;s play that! We will be the fairies, and these
barrels will be the cargo. We have to deliver them to
Dewington below.&#8221;
<!--l. 2193--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;To Dewington?&#8221; Greg asked slowly swaying.
<!--l. 2195--><p class="indent" >   They hatched a plan together. Dewington was not
exactly below the pasture, but was visible from its edge.
They piled up the mead-filled barrels, bowls, table
linens, and blankets at one end of the leaf, and Greg
wrapped them into a neat package. They attached
the package to the other end of the leaf with a long
thread of Greg&#8217;s silk and let the loose thread fall off
around the edge of the leaf, so that it would run below
it.
<!--l. 2202--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Are you ready, Greg?&#8221; asked Philip. They had pushed
the cargo to the edge of the leaf together and only
needed one more nudge to let it go.
<!--l. 2205--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s go,&#8221; Greg replied. With another shove
the center of mass of the package was over the edge. The
bundle of barrels and sacks slowly tumbled. As it rolled
over, Philip and Greg climbed on it, and when the
spider&#8217;s thread went taut, they were sitting on the
top.
<!--l. 2210--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;We are swinging in the right direction, Greg!&#8221; Philip
shouted as they flew. &#8220;But our swing does not reach all
the way to Dewington.&#8221;
<!--l. 2213--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;We are just getting started,&#8221; Greg replied. &#8220;Check out
how a spider swings!&#8221;
<!--l. 2216--><p class="indent" >   Greg added more and more silk to their thread. He
always added the extra length as they were reaching
the highest point of the swing. He skillfully took
advantage of air movements too, and tightened and
loosened the line in a way that kept accelerating their
cargo.
<!--l. 2221--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Here we go!&#8221; Philip cheered. &#8220;Look, Dewington is
right below us!&#8221;
<!--l. 2223--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Prepare for mooring!&#8221; said Greg. The next time they
swung above the target, he threw himself fearlessly off
the shipment. Philip reached for him in a moment of
panic, but then understood what the little spider was
doing. Greg had started a new thread off the swinging
cargo and anchored the other end to the leaf when he
landed in Dewington.
<!--l. 2229--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Hold on!&#8221; he shouted from below, but it was too late.
The new thread went taut, restrained the swing of the
package over the village square, and Philip tumbled off
of it. The fairy would have plunged straight into the
sparkling dewdrop if not for the webbing that covered
their cargo. He managed to hold on to the knot of
spider silk and was dangling from the bottom of the
package.
<!--l. 2235--><p class="indent" >   The package of hundreds of barrels of mead was
bigger than the dewdrop. All eyes in the main square
were on Philip.
<!--l. 2238--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Philip, do not squirm,&#8221; Greg said, and began to
climb up. &#8220;If the mooring breaks, you will be swinging
there all day. And I get a swimming lesson in your
dewdrop!&#8221;
<!--l. 2242--><p class="indent" >   Philip obediently stopped moving and hung forlornly
from the package. Greg arrived and attached a new
thread to a barrel. Not sparing a glance for Philip, he
descended with the new thread while carefully avoiding
the dewdrop through the use of air currents. He tied the
tether to the top of a house and climbed back on it.
He extended three more threads the same way and
moored the shipment perfectly. When Philip felt
that not even a butterfly would be strong enough to
break the package free, he climbed over to a tether
and descended to the leaf. Spiders loved hanging
from a silk thread all day long, but it was not for
Philip.
<!--l. 2252--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I cannot believe my eyes,&#8221; Raisy welcomed them.
&#8220;That&#8217;s enough brandy to fill a dozen rockets, Philip. And
such graceful delivery!&#8221;
<!--l. 2255--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;This is not brandy, but mead,&#8221; Philip corrected
her. &#8220;We still have to distill the spirit, and collect it
somewhere. Over there &#x2026;&#x00A0;is that Mary?&#8221;
<!--l. 2258--><p class="indent" >   Mary looked as if Jimbo, the clay monster, had come
to life. The first nozzle that they built was too soft, and
when it started to collapse Mary tried to hold it together.
Unfortunately, they had to start over, but nothing more
than a little bit of time and the clay that had stuck to
Mary was lost.
<!--l. 2263--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Yes, it is me. Over there is Raspy,&#8221; she pointed at the
clay-covered worm circling the unfinished nozzle, &#8220;and
on the inside is his partner, Cranny. We are molding the
shape very carefully to avoid defects. But we will be
ready soon.&#8221;
<!--l. 2268--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;May I peek inside the nozzle?&#8221; asked Greg as he
landed.
<!--l. 2270--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;No,&#8221; replied Mary. &#8220;You did not help Philip to climb
down.&#8221;
<!--l. 2272--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;But he was hanging so comfortably. I hang like that
all day.&#8221;
<!--l. 2274--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;But he is not a spider!&#8221;
<!--l. 2276--><p class="indent" >   Greg and Mary continued the debate while Raspy and
Cranny shaped the clay.
<!--l. 2278--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 2280--><p class="noindent" >   &#8220;I have finished the calculations, Philip,&#8221; Raisy said.
They found a place to sit down among the heaps of notes
covering the terrace of the caf. Raisy swept all but one
page off the table. She smoothed this one neatly
and turned it to Philip. &#8220;The results for the various
constructions. Unfortunately, we get a number that is less
than zero for almost every structure. These would break
up in the air. But this one works.&#8221;
<!--l. 2287--><p class="indent" >   Columns of numbers were accompanied by tiny
illustrations depicting the structures.
<!--l. 2290--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;A sphere!&#8221; said Philip as he found the winning
variation. &#8220;We need to build a sphere then?&#8221;
<!--l. 2293--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;And not just any sphere. Only cold-forged chitin is
strong enough. If we just glued or riveted plates together,
the chitin would fall apart,&#8221; she said pointing to the next
row of the table.
<!--l. 2297--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I know such a sphere.&#8221;
<!--l. 2299--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;You do? Who built it?&#8221;
<!--l. 2301--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Balthazar, the caterpillar,&#8221; said Philip.
<!--l. 2303--><p class="indent" >   They both rose up and went to have an audience with
the king. The evening rain had soaked the dead surface
of the Stain, so it was soggy now. But at least there
was no risk of sudden cracks. A few black bacteria
were grazing around Balthazar&#8217;s severed head. They
scattered when Philip and Raisy reached the door and
knocked.
<!--l. 2309--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Oh, nice to see you, Philip,&#8221; George said when he
opened the door on the caterpillar&#8217;s head. &#8220;I&#x00A0;was not
expecting guests today. The Stain is so muddy. But come
on in. I am George, former king of Dewington.&#8221;
<!--l. 2313--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I am Raisy, a friend of Philip&#8217;s. The gust from the
rocket launch yesterday has flown me here from a distant
pine tree. The children are helping me return home. We
are building a rocket of our own and flying to my
home.&#8221;
<!--l. 2317--><p class="indent" >   George&#8217;s mouth dropped open.
<!--l. 2319--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I have traveled a lot when I was young. I have
even been to a branch of the neighboring tree. But
the pines are on the other side of the valley! Unless
the wind that carried you here is kind enough to
take you back, I am afraid there is no way to the
pines.&#8221;
<!--l. 2324--><p class="indent" >   Raisy just smiled and pulled out a roll of paper.
George sat them at his table, made a pot of sweet tea,
and listened to the grand plan. Although he was not
taught at school, he had a sharp wit and asked many
serious questions. Raisy was happy to have someone
check her calculations and explained everything
enthusiastically. George smiled ever more broadly, but
was most pleased to learn that Balthazar&#8217;s head would be
the ideal rocket hull.
<!--l. 2331--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Are you saying I do not even have to set foot outside
of my home, and we will fly all the way to the pine
trees?&#8221;
<!--l. 2334--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;We will need to make some transformations,&#8221; Raisy
said. &#8220;We have to fill the lower level with brandy.&#8221;
<!--l. 2337--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Yes, absolutely. That will not be a problem. Where
do you have the fuel now?&#8221;
<!--l. 2340--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;It is hanging above the main square in barrels,&#8221;
Philip chimed in. &#8220;But we still have to distill it.&#8221;
<!--l. 2343--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Let us get to it quickly. I am sure Raisy is sorely
missed at home.&#8221;
<!--l. 2345--><p class="indent" >   George and Philip headed out to organize the
distillation. Raisy stayed in the head of the caterpillar
and started the necessary remodeling.
<!--l. 2348--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 2350--><p class="noindent" >   Dewington residents helped Raisy arrange the
heavy plates and beams on the day before. They also
watched with interest as Mary and the two worms
struggled with the clay since the morning. But they had
not taken their work entirely seriously, and most
did not even know what their goal was. Now more
and more fairies stopped in the main square and,
looking up at the huge bundle of mead, they asked one
another.
<!--l. 2357--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;What is in those barrels?&#8221;
<!--l. 2359--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I do not know, but it was delivered from up above.
From the pasture.&#8221;
<!--l. 2361--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;It must be honeydew then. But we would not drink
so much honeydew in a whole winter&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#8221;
<!--l. 2364--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;It is not for drinking! They will burn it all in a flying
house.&#8221;
<!--l. 2366--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Yes, I heard they want to fly to the Moon, because it
is eternal winter there.&#8221;
<!--l. 2369--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Why do they want to get to the Moon if there is
eternal winter there?&#8221;
<!--l. 2371--><p class="indent" >   A growing crowd of fairies exchanged such questions
and hypotheses on the main square. They nudged each
other and fell silent when they saw George arrive. He
looked majestic in his purple armor and big white beard.
He smiled and waved at Mary, then spoke to the
fairies.
<!--l. 2376--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Balthazar, the caterpillar, drank our water, chewed
on our houses, and poisoned our leaf. Of the palace
grounds only a brown stain remains. Today, however, we
can be grateful to him because he left behind a real
treasure in return. His desiccated head.&#8221;
<!--l. 2381--><p class="indent" >   At this point George was surrounded by many a
raised eyebrow. Holding up a hand, he carried on with
the explanation.
<!--l. 2384--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Fall is upon us, and today or tomorrow Dewington
too will begin to lose its green color. All the trees turn
yellow and red, and all the fairies seek refuge. But there
is a distant tree where these days are just like any other.
The pines do not care about the winter. The fairies
insulate their homes with resin and continue their work
until spring. And, thanks to Balthazar, we too will have a
place to stay during the coming winter. We are building a
rocket out of his head and flying across the valley. We are
connecting the two trees with a long line of spider
silk, allowing us all to get across. The blue-skinned
brothers and sisters living in the pine will welcome
our caravans laden with mead and spices, and will
teach us to build our homes in one of the countless
needles.&#8221;
<!--l. 2396--><p class="indent" >   The fairies moved closer and their hearts filled with
hope. No one was looking forward to the winter. The
dark and the cold were the enemy of all life. Waiting
for the spring in their tiny shelters was a desperate
struggle.
<!--l. 2400--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;And what will raise the spirits of our distant relatives
the most?&#8221; George continued. &#8220;The brandy! As our luck
would have it, Raisy here was carried all the way from
the pine by yesterday&#8217;s storm. She says aphids do not live
on the needles. Thus, the blue fairies rarely taste
anything sweet and know not the hearty warmth of
spirits. It is a miracle they can survive the winter. So let
us cook as much brandy as we can! Let us load up
Balthazar&#8217;s head with the golden liquid! And let us build
the bridge between the two trees! The brandy will also
serve as propellant for the rocket, but what is left at the
end of the trip will be our present to the residents of the
pine.&#8221;
<!--l. 2410--><p class="indent" >   The drink was a symbol of rare celebrations on
Dewington. They did not produce brandy locally, and it
was a long way from Solperla. The arrival and supply of
merchants from the city was unpredictable. Thus the
mention of the drink filled the fairies gathered in the
square with enthusiasm. Now they just wanted to know
how they could be a part of the plan.
<!--l. 2416--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Philip, the little explorer, has ingeniously delivered the
mead, from which the brandy is made, and contrived a
process for its distillation. Please follow his instructions.
Philip, where do we start?&#8221;
<!--l. 2420--><p class="indent" >   Philip had never been so proud, but as much as he
straightened up, he was still only visible from the front
row. He climbed onto the bench in the focal point of the
drop and started to coordinate the volunteers while
standing in the bright light.
<!--l. 2425--><p class="indent" >   As the first step, the children climbed up the threads
to the barrels. The adults gathered below them and
caught the barrels as they were released. A little girl also
released from the tangle a drop of mead bundled in a
sheet, but it opened when a volunteer caught it and
covered him in the fermented juice. They took more
care after that and passed the bundles down in a
chain.
<!--l. 2431--><p class="indent" >   As the cargo dwindled Greg pulled on the threads to
keep them taut. Once all the mead had landed, he tied
the threads into one knot in the place where the bundle
had been. The line coming down from the pasture was
now anchored in several points on Dewington, similar to
what Philip had seen in Solperla.
<!--l. 2436--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;There is a thick branch a little to the east above
Dewington,&#8221; Philip pointed. &#8220;The leaves are warming up
in the morning light, but that branch is still in shadow. If
the spirits evaporate from the barrels under it, the
brandy will condense on the cold bark. Come and help
Greg tighten the lines so that Dewington is pulled under
the branch!&#8221;
<!--l. 2442--><p class="indent" >   Using the method learned in Solperla, they set out
to move Dewington by pulling on the web. All the
sweat of the strongest fairies was in vain though. The
web would would not budge a bit. John even let
Anaconda help them, but still they were not strong
enough.
<!--l. 2447--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;The edge of the leaf is under the branch. Would
it not be easier to carry the mead there?&#8221; said the
accidentally doused volunteer. He was the baker of
Dewington, but his usual smell of delicious bread had
now been replaced by the stink of mash, and everyone
kept a distance from him.
<!--l. 2452--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;No point in carrying only the mead, as we could
not distill it without the drop,&#8221; Philip explained.
&#8220;Which is easier? To transport the drop to the edge
of the leaf, or to figure out how to contract these
threads?&#8221;
<!--l. 2456--><p class="indent" >   They discussed the matter for a while, but since they
had no clear plan for either approach, they could not
decide which one was easier. They had to hurry,
however, because once the sun warmed the branch, they
would have nowhere to condense the fuel. They
formed two teams. Philip set out to implement the
principle of winches that he had learned on Solperla.
Peter, the baker, set out to roll the dewdrop like a
bun.
<!--l. 2463--><p class="indent" >   Greg insisted that all lines were equally tense in a
good web, but Philip still examined them one by one.
He even climbed to the roof of a house so he could
pull on the tether, and here he finally felt a bit of
give.
<!--l. 2467--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;It must have loosened when the shipment was
unloaded,&#8221; Greg said. No one blamed him. They were
happy to have found a line which they could hope to
handle.
<!--l. 2471--><p class="indent" >   An older member of their team fetched a hair that
must have been shed by a caterpillar. It was a smooth,
strong rod, about twice as thick as a fairy&#8217;s finger. They
hoped to be able to loop the thread around it, so they
could then start winding it, thereby slowly pulling the
leaf toward the branch. Trying to twist the silk around
the hair, the team wrestled with the thread until Philip
fell off the roof.
<!--l. 2478--><p class="indent" >   Anaconda sniffed at the sprawled fairy boy. Philip
grinned mischievously, grabbed his reins and led him up
to the roof. At this point the owner of the house, a pretty
young lady, came out to her porch and watched with her
hands on her hips.
<!--l. 2483--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;I heard you playing on my roof, but I did not expect
to see you trying to loop a spider&#8217;s line around a
caterpillar&#8217;s hair with help from a nematode.&#8221;
<!--l. 2486--><p class="indent" >   But that was exactly what was going on, and
after a bit more struggle they succeeded at it. They
had all worked up a sweat, but after the first twist
they did not have to worry anymore that the hair
would pop out of the loop. Two fairies could grab the
long pole on each end now and push with all their
strength to wind the silk thread. Every turn brought
Dewington a little closer to the dark arch of the tree
branch.
<!--l. 2493--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;It is working!&#8221; Philip rejoiced. &#8220;I&#x00A0;will let Peter know
they do not need to roll the drop.&#8221;
<!--l. 2496--><p class="indent" >   The clever baker had not been as lucky as Philip. His
team was excitedly running around the dewdrop, trying
to figure out how to rescue Peter from it. The poor fairy
was floating upside down inside the drop, trying to
paddle toward his friends.
<!--l. 2501--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Philip, what are you doing?&#8221; boomed John&#8217;s deep
voice at them. &#8220;That fairy is about to drown! Where is
Anaconda?&#8221;
<!--l. 2504--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;On the roof,&#8221; Philip pointed.
<!--l. 2506--><p class="indent" >   John cast a surprised look, then called the nematode
with a long whistle. He held up his hand with a short
whistle, then pointed to Peter while whistling a third
time. Anaconda immediately understood the task. His
pointy nose crossed the surface of the drop as if it
had never been there. He was fast on land but even
faster in the water. He reached Peter in the blink
of an eye, coiled around his entire body and took
off to leave the drop. His nose easily pierced the
surface again, but he got stuck when he tried to pull
out Peter. Fortunately, the fairies were there at once
and, taking hold of his bridle, heaved them both
through.
<!--l. 2516--><p class="indent" >   Peter spat out a lot of water but was not hurt. He had
endless gratitude for Anaconda. Once he recovered fully,
he jumped on his feet and fetched some alga scones from
the bakery to reward his rescuer.
<!--l. 2520--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 2522--><p class="noindent" >   Two fairies lifted a barrel, carried it to the light
collected in the focal point of the drop and, as
recommended by Alexander, shook it thoroughly. Due to
the shaking the mead warmed evenly and started fizzing
once it was warm enough. The brown liquid bubbled up
and let out an intoxicating smell. Then the foam
collapsed and the barrel stopped fizzing. They carried it
off and the next pair of fairies with the next barrel took
their place in the sunlight.
<!--l. 2529--><p class="indent" >   Philip and Greg were watching the procedure from
the bottom of the branch above Dewington. Greg&#8217;s claws
were sharp enough to hold on to the surface of the
branch, while Philip sat very careful on the edge of a
plate of bark, dangling his feet. The shade was quite
cold, and Greg regretted that his winter coat was not
done yet.
<!--l. 2535--><p class="indent" >   Soon after the fairies began the distillation, the
stinging smell reached the branch. Upon contact with the
cold surface the spirits condensed and formed tiny
globules. Philip was watching eagerly and still did not
notice them right away. The dew formed droplets too
small for the eye to see. The droplets covered everything,
and whenever they touched each other they fused into a
larger droplet.
<!--l. 2542--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Look, Greg! You are covered in golden beads!&#8221;
<!--l. 2544--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;So is your hair, Philip! There is a little bead at the
end of each strand!&#8221;
<!--l. 2546--><p class="indent" >   They both swept up the beads and merged them into
a radiant orb that just fit in Philip&#8217;s palm. As he rolled the
ball around in his hand, its size grew ever so slightly. At
the same time new droplets appeared in his hair. The
brandy also collected on the tips of the bark and formed
balls of a similar size to the one that Philip held in his
hand. When he touched his ball to one growing on an
outcropping, they merged, and a larger drop now sat
trembling on the ledge.
<!--l. 2554--><p class="indent" >   Philip and Greg both enjoyed the game. They realized
that merging the droplets was not just fun, but also
necessary. The small droplets evaporated, the large
droplets stayed around. Greg made a small web and
dragged it across the bark with two feet while he crawled
around with the other six, sweeping up a large golden
sphere. Philip visited the internal cavities of the bark and
ousted the pearls that had collected there. They merged
the drops into one, which kept growing with every barrel
that the fairies distilled below. When it grew larger than
Philip, Greg fastened it with a couple loose threads to
be safe. They did not restrict its growth, but made
sure that it would only drop down when they were
ready.
<!--l. 2565--><p class="indent" >   The boys kept hunting after the beads until the
barrels ran out below. &#8220;That was all,&#8221; shouted George
from Dewington. &#8220;That was the last barrel. Raisy says the
drop looks great!&#8221;
<!--l. 2569--><p class="indent" >   Indeed, it was rather large. The unusual smell drew
out the inhabitants of the tree. Creatures of all shapes
and sizes were looking at the golden drop. Its rotund
form in the shade was about the same size as the
sparkling dewdrop in the main square of Dewington
below. A ring of fairies surrounded that lower drop,
gazing up at the one above. The unusual sight made the
fairies in the small streets halt too, and filled them with
delight. Someone had climbed on the top of their
house to watch the drop hanging from the branch
above.
<!--l. 2578--><p class="indent" >   The bark of the tree also filled with gleaming eyes
fixed on the fruit of the morning&#8217;s hard work. Spiders,
mites, tardigrades, caterpillars, larvae, and even adult
insects watched curiously. The midges danced excitedly
around the brandy, and the hum of their wings filled the
air.
<!--l. 2583--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Peter, you can start unwinding,&#8221; Philip called down.
&#8220;Move Dewington to the second stop!&#8221;
<!--l. 2586--><p class="indent" >   The team on the roof of the house, responsible for
winding the spider silk, grabbed the rod of hair again.
They turned it in the opposite direction this time, but it
was still not an easy task. If it slipped out of their
hands, the knot would unfold and the leaf break
free.
<!--l. 2591--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;And here we are,&#8221; said Philip shortly. The drop of
fuel hung precisely above Balthazar&#8217;s head.
<!--l. 2594--><p class="separator" ><span 
class="pzdr-">&#x2766;</span>
<!--l. 2596--><p class="noindent" >   &#8220;Here they are,&#8221; said Mary from the caterpillar&#8217;s eye.
George had built two well-lit reading rooms beneath the
enormous eyes. The comfortable couches were now
glued to the floor with mucilage. The fairies collected the
strong glue from a particularly slimy variety of alga.
Raisy and George had fixed all the furniture and
ornaments in preparation for the flight. Mary had even
renamed the rooms. The reading room became the
cockpit. The kitchen on the ground floor became the
machine room. Raisy was busy installing the nozzle
there.
<!--l. 2604--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Just a moment,&#8221; Raisy said. &#8220;Let me check the
sealant once more, and then we can load it up.&#8221;
<!--l. 2607--><p class="indent" >   They had glued the nozzle in place with mucilage as
well. Raisy rapped along the bond and was pleased to
find that it had set well. The opening of the nozzle was
stuffed with wool from parameciums, and a long wick
ran outside from it. Raisy inspected this as well, then
climbed up the stairs.
<!--l. 2612--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Come Mary, we better watch this from the outside.&#8221;
<!--l. 2614--><p class="indent" >   They scrambled down the hastily constructed stairs
from the top floor to the brown swamp of the Stain, then
retreated from the huge skull and started jumping and
waving.
<!--l. 2618--><p class="indent" >   This was the signal Philip and Greg were waiting for
above. To make sure the precious drop would fall
straight they waited until the air stood completely still
for a moment, then released the silk tethers from the two
sides at once. The drop started to stretch and then
separated from the bark. A moment later it hit the
repurposed head of the caterpillar. Thanks to the perfect
aim, almost all of the fuel fell into place. It flooded the
upper floor through the opening cut into the roof,
then streamed down the staircase into the machine
room.
<!--l. 2626--><p class="indent" >   Mary and Raisy had not entirely avoided the
splashing liquid. They jumped around squealing and
shaking the fragrant drops from their hair. Raisy paused,
licked her lips and nodded with satisfaction.
<!--l. 2630--><p class="indent" >   Philip and Greg descended between them on a
thread, and the time came to say goodbye.
<!--l. 2633--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Lunch is almost done,&#8221; Greg said. &#8220;My mother will
ground me if I do not get home in time. Take this thread.
Attach it to the rocket, and we will make sure that no
matter how far you go it does not snap. Thank you for
playing with me and have a nice journey!&#8221;
<!--l. 2638--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Have a nice journey, Philip,&#8221; his mother said. &#8220;It is
very nice of you to help Raisy. Enjoy your time on the
pine tree, but come home soon!&#8221;
<!--l. 2641--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Have a nice journey, Mary,&#8221; her father said. &#8220;You did
an amazing job! Learn well from Raisy. Take Babouche
with you, he will watch out for you.&#8221;
<!--l. 2644--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Have a nice journey, Raisy,&#8221; John said. &#8220;I&#x00A0;hope to see
you soon and share stories of our latest adventures!&#8221;
<!--l. 2647--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Come on, get in!&#8221; George said. &#8220;The fuel has soaked
the cotton. We have to get going.&#8221;
<!--l. 2650--><p class="indent" >   Before boarding they waved to the fairies gathered
around the rocket. Then the onlookers withdrew from
the Stain to avoid getting scorched by the fire of
the engine. The crowd of fairies lit the wick at the
edge of the Stain and waited for the take-off hand in
hand.
<!--l. 2655--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two,
one&#x00A0;&#x2026;&#8221;
<!--l. 2657--><p class="indent" >   The fire reached the rocket, and a deep rumbling was
heard from Balthazar&#8217;s head. The sound slowly grew
louder, and a blinding light flooded Dewington. Everyone
on the leaf took cover, while the travelers inside the head
tightened their safety harnesses. With a sudden jerk the
rocket took off.
<!--l. 2662--><p class="indent" >   The fire dried the Stain and even charred its center,
but did not significantly damage the leaf. The rocket rose
ever more rapidly among the branches, and a moment
later only a bright pinpoint of light was visible from
the leaf. The spider thread they had glued to it had
skyrocketed.
<!--l. 2667--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;We are flying!&#8221; they cheered in Balthazar&#8217;s head.
<!--l. 2669--><p class="indent" >   &#8220;The trajectory is good too. We only need to turn
three degrees to the left,&#8221; Raisy said as she excitedly
compared measurements and calculations. George
pulled on a handle that adjusted the inclination of
an external flap and changed their orientation a
little.
<!--l. 2674--><p class="indent" >   From the cockpit Philip and Mary watched the
scenery unfolding below them, their hearts overflowing
with the joy of discovery.
